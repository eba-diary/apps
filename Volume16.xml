Davis.</persName> Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <orgName ref="#Nile">Nile,</orgName> including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

                <p>We are nearing the end of this part of our voyage &#8211; having sailed from <placeName>New York</placeName> Saturday the 24th Oct. <persName>Mary Newberry</persName> who had been spending the week there, and <persName>Anita Ohio</persName> went down to see us off. Mrs. And Mr. <persName>Walter Jennings</persName> and family &#8211; 2 children, 2 maids, tutor and governess, with <persName>Miss Gallandet,</persName> and sister <persName>Miss Jennings,</persName> were fellow passengers. They are relatives of Mrs. <persName>Hugh Amkincloss,</persName> who was <persName>Miss Jennings.</persName> Mr. and Mrs. <persName>Herbert Pell,</persName> also on board. A dull voyage, much rain and warm &#8211; I occupied for the 3rd time the <orgName>Captain's</orgName> charming rooms on the bridge &#8211; and what lovely hours of rest and quiet I had, after all the din and stir of the summer. The steamer is comfortable but slow, we reached <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName> on the 11th day and ought to be in <placeName>Naples</placeName> tonight, only we won't, at least we hope to make our steamer tomorrow.</p>

                <p>We did just make our steamer the <orgName>&#8216;Preussen'</orgName> on Friday &#8211; Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Pell</persName> with us. We all occupied the <orgName>Captain's</orgName> and officer's rooms on the bridge &#8211; and were very comfortable &#8211; landed at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> at 3 this P.M. got the train, and at 7 o'clock were installed in our familiar rooms on the pleasant garden. We have never been so early before. Not many people yet. <pb n="61"/> <persName>Eldon</persName> and <persName>Lady Gorst.</persName> <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Pell</persName> have been dining with us. We have had a busy 10 days in <placeName>Cairo.</placeName> Every one has been so kind. We went to <placeName>Lady Gorsts</placeName> to a garden party &#8211; to the <orgName>Iddings</orgName> to dine &#8211; and to a tea, where we met delightful people. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Iddings</persName> dined with us that evening, and Capt. <persName>Trefusis</persName> &#8211; <persName>M. Maspero</persName> another evening, and the Capt. Who also lunched with us. The great event was <name>Theo's</name> presentation to the <orgName>Khedive,</orgName> which Mr <persName>Iddings</persName> has been trying to persuade him to do for 3 years &#8211; but this year he consented &#8211; and he was received in a private audience. Mr. <persName>Iddings</persName> came for him in his own carriage, with his decorative <orgName>Kavass,</orgName> and 2 gorgeous running <persName>Sayces,</persName> and <persName>Theo</persName> had to appear in frock coat and top hat at 10 in the morning. I couldn't but laugh when I saw them drive off in such style, for I knew how he hated it. It was very successful however, and Mr. <persName>Iddings</persName> told me he had never seen the <persName>Khedive</persName> so interested in an interview.</p>

                <p>In town with <persName>Theo</persName> this morning, doing last things. Capt. <persName>Trefusis</persName> lunched with us. Our tug took us to the bridge landing at 1 o'clock and we hoped to get through the draw comfortably. But the usual scrimmage occurred &#8211; and we came near losing the top of our big boom. Then we had to get through the new <placeName>Ghizeh</placeName> bridge &#8211; we landed the Capt. And waited until most of the gyassas had passed through. We got as far as the big Sugar station, 5 miles below <placeName>Bedreschein</placeName> &#8211; very cold.</p>

                <p>A very early start, before dawn. Such a beautiful hour followed! The sunrise, and this strange, interesting land, and the quiet hour of reading and reflection, nothing can ever take it from me. A fine day, with strong <placeName>N.W.</placeName> wind, which meeting the strong current of the river, made quite a sea. We reached <persName>Nagh Hamadi</persName> at 3 o'clock thinking the bridge opened at 3:30 but found it opened at 3 o'clock &#8211; so we were forced to stay the night. It was quiet enough &#8211; and the late afternoon and evening most lovely.</p>

                <p>We passed the bridge most easily at 7:30 &#8211; before I got up. The tug took us up as far as the difficult turn at <placeName>Kasr es Sayd</placeName> &#8211; then left us with much hearty leave-takings and receiving of liberal backsheesh. The day was absolutely calm, and we were left alone in the middle of the river, with both sails limply hanging &#8211; we have tracked, pulled to the anchor and sailed a little very quietly and are now lying <pb n="64"/> within sight of <persName>Dishneh</persName> &#8211; a most exquisite evening. 17 miles.</p>

                 <p>Made an early start this morning in a good wind, and reached this high bank, one mile below <placeName>Nagada</placeName> at 5.30. An exciting day &#8211; the boat careering madly along &#8211; sailors shouting &#8211; sails changing, and all the clamor of a sharp sailing. The morning was delicious &#8211; I was on deck all the time until we were delayed by a gyassa which cut across our bow in an awkward way, and going immediately upon the sand just in front of us, we had to pull up so sharply that we went with a great thump on the bank &#8211; there was a great tumbling about of all movable things &#8211; and when I came below to see about it - I found <persName>Amelie, Jones, Hassein,</persName> and <persName>Hassoun</persName> busy setting everything straight. Last year we came on the boat Nov. 30. We are much in advance this year!</p>

Last night about 12 o'clock, I was aroused by cries that I thought must be those of a jackal &#8211; it proved to have been a man in the river. Six men had gone to our opposite neighbor Mr. <persName>Insingers,</persName> to rob and steal. They overpowered the night watchman, and one of them got into the house. Mr. <persName>Insinger</persName> sent a shot at the man, who ran, followed by Mr. <persName>Insinger</persName> firing at him &#8211; the man took to the river, and found the current so strong that he screamed for help. The police appeared and caught the man, who gave the names of the men with him. There is a great deal of lawlessness about the country and some alarm felt.</p>

                <p><persName>Harold</persName> found yesterday in the last corner of the pit tomb, a most lovely alabaster statuette of a woman &#8211; about 9 in. high, the most perfect specimen of <orgName>Egyptian</orgName> art I have ever seen, and in perfect condition. To think of her lying under that hard mud for nearly 3000 years! no inscription. It is thought it may represent the wife of Thut-ankh-amen.

                <p>We were distressed and amazed this morning at breakfast to <pb n="71"/> Hear of poor <placeName>Corinna's</placeName> disaster. She was here yesterday morning as usual. I thought she looked very tired and troubled. She had many things to do in town, before she went back to their camp. The <name>Petries</name> were dining with them. She was then suffering extremely from pain in one eye &#8211; which grew so bad that she became delirious. They (she and <persName>Joe)</persName> got some donkeys and came at a walk all the way to the river, where they quietly aroused some of our sailors, who rowed them across to <placeName>Luxor</placeName> to the doctor. He advised them to go at once to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> &#8211; and they now are on their way there. It is a hideous experience for the poor things &#8211; a very bad case of opthalmia. The <name>Walter Browns</name> here to tea. 8 1908-1909 8 8</p>
