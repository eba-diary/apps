          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</name> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the <orgName ref="#'Golden_Age'">'Golden Age'</orgName> of <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</name> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <name ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington.</name> <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis.</persName> Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <orgName ref="#Nile">Nile,</orgName> including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

A dull voyage, much rain and warm &#8211; I occupied for the 3rd time the Captain's charming rooms on the bridge &#8211; and what lovely hours of rest and quiet I had, after all the din and stir of the summer. The steamer is comfortable but slow, we reached <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> on the 11th day and ought to be in <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> tonight, only we won't, at least we hope to make our steamer tomorrow.</p>

The great event was<persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName>'s presentation to <persName ref="#Abbas_II">the Khedive</persName>, which <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr.">Mr. Iddings</persName> has been trying to persuade him to do for 3 years &#8211; but this year he consented &#8211; and he was received in a private audience. <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr.">Mr. Iddings</persName> came for him in his own carriage, with his decorative Kavass, and 2 gorgeous running Sayces, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> had to appear in frock coat and top hat at 10 in the morning. I couldn't but laugh when I saw them drive off in such style, for I knew how he hated it. It was very successful however, and <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr.">Mr. Iddings</persName> told me he had never seen the <persName ref="#Abbas_II">the Khedive</persName> so interested in an interview.</p>

Then we had to get through the new <placeName ref="Giza">Ghizeh</placeName> bridge &#8211; we landed <persName ref="#Trefusis_Walter">the Capt.</persName> And waited until most of the gyassas had passed through.

The sunrise, and this strange, interesting land, and the quiet hour of reading and reflection, nothing can ever take it from me. A fine day, with strong N.W. wind, which meeting the strong current of the river, made quite a sea. We reached <placeName ref="#Naj_Hammadi">Nagh Hamadi</placeName> at 3 o'clock thinking the bridge opened at 3:30 but found it opened at 3 o'clock &#8211; so we were forced to stay the night.

The day was absolutely calm, and we were left alone in the middle of the river, with both sails limply hanging &#8211; we have tracked, pulled to the anchor and sailed a little very quietly and are now lying <pb n="64"/> within sight of <placeName ref="#Dishna">Dishneh</placeName> &#8211; a most exquisite evening. 17 miles.</p>

An exciting day &#8211; the boat careering madly along &#8211; sailors shouting &#8211; sails changing, and all the clamor of a sharp sailing. The morning was delicious &#8211; I was on deck all the time until we were delayed by a gyassa which cut across our bow in an awkward way, and going immediately upon the sand just in front of us, we had to pull up so sharply that we went with a great thump on the bank &#8211; there was a great tumbling about of all movable things &#8211; and when I came below to see about it - I found <persName ref="#Amelie">Amelie</persName>, <persName ref="#Jones_Harold">Jones</persName>, <persName ref="#Hassein">Hassein</persName>, and <persName ref="#Hassoun">Hassoun</persName> busy setting everything straight.
