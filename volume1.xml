          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</name> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the <orgName ref="#Golden_Age">'Golden Age'</orgName> of <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</name> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <name ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington</name>. <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis</persName>. Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <orgName ref="#Nile">Nile</orgName>, including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley</placeName> of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering <orgName ref="#Egyptologists">Egyptologists</orgName> of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

A dull and uneventful voyage - and a most disagreeable landing in a heavy storm of wind and rain, in a tug, with no protection but that our umbrellas and wraps gave us. Came to our old quarters at <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Chatham">Hotel Chatham</name>.</p>

        <p> We left <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> on the <date when="1889-12-05">5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> at 8.30 a.m. for <placeName ref="#Marseilles">Marseilles</placeName>. I had been suffering with a severe cold, and confined to the house and often to my room during our stay in <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName>. The weather was raw and cold all the time, and the day of our journey to <placeName ref="#Marseilles">Marseilles</placeName> was very cold - and the ride seemed excessively long and tiring. We spent a night at the "<name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_du_Louvre_et_de_la_Paix">Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix</name>" at <placeName ref="#Marseilles">Marseilles</placeName>, and took a drive the next morning through the streets and along the quays - a cold wind blowing. There had just passed over <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName>, or rather the south of <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName>, one of the worst mistrals ever known and houses in <placeName ref="#Avignon">Avignon</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Nismes">Nismes</placeName> blown down, ships unable to enter or leave the port or <placeName ref="#Marseilles">Marseilles</placeName> for <hi rend="underline">days</hi>, snow at <placeName ref="#Nice">Nice</placeName> etc. so that our disappointment in regard to seeing <placeName ref="#Avignon">Avignon</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Nismes">Nismes</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Arles">Arles</placeName>, which we had planned to do on our way down to <placeName ref="#Marseilles">Marseilles</placeName>, and which my illness prevented, was mitigated.</p>
       <p><pb n="2"/>We sailed in the "<name type="boat" ref="#Gironde">Gironde</name>" of the Massagieres Maritime line, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The boat proved an excellent one -- good service, table and rooms. We found among the passengers Miss <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Sara Gibbs</persName> of <placeName ref="#Newport">Newport</placeName>. The first night out was excessively cold and rough -- and I went early to bed, grasping my hot water bag, and soon forgot the discomforts. The next morning we had a summer sea to sail over, and we were passing between <placeName ref="#Corsica">Corsica</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>, and with a glass could distinguish the houses on either island. In the afternoon we were approaching the <placeName ref="#Strait_of_Messina">Straits of Messina</placeName>, and a lovely scene it was! For a time it seemed impossible to decide which was the main shore, and which was <placeName ref="#Sicily">Sicily</placeName> -- and we were apparently steaming dead into the rocky shore of the <placeName ref="#Aspromonte">Aspromonte</placeName> promontory. Everyone was on deck gazing at the beautiful and interesting shores, soon the <placeName ref="#Strait_of_Messina">Strait</placeName> defined itself, each shore near enough to see the houses plainly without glasses. A heavy mass of clouds hung about the volcanic island of <placeName ref="#Isola_Stromboli">Stromboli</placeName>, one of the <placeName ref="#Isole_Eolie">Lipari</placeName> group, and over <placeName ref="#Sicily">Sicily</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#Mount_Etna">Aetna</placeName> could not be seen, as we struck straight off across the <placeName ref="#Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</placeName> under the Italian shore, for <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, which we reached the evening of the <date when="1889-12-11">11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> early. We were a long time landing - <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> absorbed and delighted at the novel costumes and appearance of the natives on the shore. We could not get into our former quarters at the "<name type="hotel" ref="#New_Khedivial_Hotel">Khedival Hotel</name>", so went to the "<name type="hotel" ref="#Abbot_Hotel">Abbot</name>" where we lunched before taking the train to <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, which we reached at 9 o'clock. We came to <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepheards_Hotel">Shepheards</name> and were soon installed in delightful rooms into which the sun looks all day - and out of our windows we look upon a spacious court, with palms and trop-</p> <pb n="3"/> <p>ical trees, among which the great black and grey crows are flying and cawing all the time.</p>
        <p>We are having a "grey day" for this part of the world - but it seems delightfully summer-like to us, even if our northern winter clothes are comfortable. We were busy this morning settling ourselves in our rooms, after which <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I walked to <persName ref="#Cook_Thomas">Cook</persName>'s office, a short distance from the hotel, and looked at plans of steamers and talked over the voyage of the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName>. After an excellent luncheon we drove out, taking <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> with us over the <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Gh&#232;sireh</placeName> road - it looking almost as natural to us as the <placeName ref="#Ocean_Drive">Ocean Drive</placeName> at <placeName ref="#Newport">Newport</placeName>, - the <placeName ref="#Kasr_el_Nil">Kasr-el-Nil</placeName> bridge, and the drives, all with the same strange motley crowd coming and going, human beings and animals. As a "first sight" there is perhaps nothing to equal it in all the world - and <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> were in constant ecstatic exclamation, while <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I though familiar with it, were impressed, and felt it rather strange and interesting that we should have familiar recollections of <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Our faithful <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed Salah</persName> had appeared early in the morning, and been duly engaged, and was occupying his customary seat on the box beside the coachman - his kindly brown face and grave dignified manner, just the same as of old.</p>

        <p>We all drove down to the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> this morning to see the "<name type="boat" ref="#Sethi">Sethi</name>" having a permission from <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cooks</orgName> - a cold wind was blowing, and blinding clouds of dust flying. We were not pleased with the appearance of the <pb n="4"/>: little steamer - I stayed at home alone in the afternoon with my troublesome cold - it cannot be induced to leave me. We talked over the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> journey and decided to go on the <name type="boat" ref="#Sethi">Sethi</name> the <date when="1890-01-01">1st of January</date>.</p>
        <p>Nowhere I believe can a more brilliant and interesting scene of its kind be found, than the great dining room at <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepheards_Hotel">Shepheards</name>. A new one has been lately added to the house, large lofty capable of seating 300 people I should judge, with masses of tropical palms and plants in groups against the white walls - People from every quarter of the globe are seated at its tables - ladies in evening dress, as well as travelling dress - and the scarlet coats of many trim swell English officers, and an occasional fez or turban, giving color to it all.</p>

        <p>Everyone complains of the bad wintry weather here - and it is I suppose unusual for <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>. But it seems curious to us - for a hot sun shines most of the time, flowers are blooming in profusion, and we have our windows open all day. There is a good deal of dust from this light soil - If the houses were only built with some provision for indoor comfort in cool weather, it would be charming. Open chimneys for fire and ventilation would make them most comfortable. But it has been stupid work for me during the past week, sitting at home with my cold, when everything is so delightful out of doors.</p>
        <p>One morning we went to the carpet bazaar and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought two or three rugs - after the usual absurd bargaining. The man demanded <measure type="currency">£106</measure>. for the lot. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> took out his little book and made <pb n="5"/>: some figures and promptly offered <measure type="currency">£28</measure> and got them!</p>

        <p>A day of steady hard rain for hours - <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> went bravely off to church - I, of course am condemned to the house - I had a visit from <persName ref="#Morell_Dr">Dr. Murison</persName>, and busied myself writing letters. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed Salah</persName> appeared at breakfast, with the huge inevitable bouquet, and a remarkable structure in sweets which he called a "Christmas cake", and which I put by for afternoon and asked <persName ref="#Hughes_Frederic_Sir">Sir Frederick</persName> and <persName ref="#Hughes_Lady">Lady Hughes</persName> and <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> to come in, and so disposed of it.</p>
        <p>We have decided against the steamer -- first <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> backed down -- then they went to look at dahabeahs, and became at once infatuated, and after visits to many <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> decided upon the "<name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>" belonging to  <persName ref="#Achmed_Prince">Prince Achmed</persName>, an iron boat, with an excellent reputation for speed, and with pretty fittings, and very good beds. Her model and fittings were so superior to those of any others that we saw, that in spite of her high price, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> decided upon her. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed</persName> went at once delightedly to work, and is now very busy with his preparations for our departure, and is arranging for our comfort in a thousand ways. One of my special cares at present is to prevent him from making a financial ruin of himself, as he insists upon buying too many things and too much of everything for us. We hope to get off on Saturday, if a favorable wind blows.</p>

        <p><pb n="6"/>: We had an early breakfast yesterday morning, during which <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName> appeared and said there <hi rend="underline">would</hi> be a wind at eleven o'clock, and the sooner we settled ourselves on the Dahabeah the better it would be. We took this declaration on faith, for the fog and damp and cold outside to our unpractised eyes did not promise much. However <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> had packed all our belongings, and we were more or less ready - our own trunks, and innumerable big hampers, mysterious rolls of wraps and carpets, were all piled in the hall by our doors, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I rushed off to two or three shops near the hotel to buy some last necessary things and when we got back we found two big carriages standing in front of the hotel, and our belongings were being stowed away in them and a cart by half a dozen smiling Arabs, who I found were members of our crew. We had invited yesterday <persName ref="#Hughes_Frederick_Sir">Sir Frederick</persName> and <persName ref="#Hughes_Lady">Lady Hughes</persName>, and <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> to lunch with us on the boat, provided a favorable wind did not arrive before lunch hour. It was arranged to send the carriage back for the <persName ref="#Hughes_Lady #Hughes_Frederick_Sir">Hughes</persName> if this did not occur. We made our adieux to our obliging landlord, and others, and were soon driving over <placeName ref="#Kasr_el_Nil">Kasr-el-Nil</placeName>, and through the market place beyond. It was so delightfully exhilerating to be thus starting out into the unknown, in the midst of so much pleasant preparation. Our driver carefully picked his way between groups of kneeling camels, and flocks of buffalo, sheep and children - then through the narrow streets of the village beyond, between the walls of the low mud houses, their occupants mostly lying or squatting on the ground in front of them. At last we came to the <pb n="7"/> river, and the dahabeah, proudly floating the stars and stripes from her mast - and all about her a great bustle of preparation, with half the population of the Arab settlement squatted on the sand in front of her in observant silence. Everything was spick and span upon the <placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName> - and a smiling welcome from <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> and crew - and so many brown helping hands held out, one could scarcely make a motion. Growing plants upon the upper deck, and flowers inside - and our trunks and belongings all in place. By this time a wind began to get up, and with it came <persName ref="#Gibbs_Sara">Miss Gibbs</persName> to say good bye, and a bunch of lovely roses for me. She had time but for a few words and exclamations at our pretty homelike air, for she had to make the bridge before the "draw" opened at 12 o'clock. Very soon the crew began their preparations for sailing, and the wind having freshened very much, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> told <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahomet Salah</persName> that we were ready - he replied that "two sailor men had gone ashore to get some tin" - but that if they did not turn up when we were ready to start, we would not wait, as they would run along the bank ahead of us, and we would pick them up - which we did afterwards - one poor fellow with two big tin pans or tubs running about <measure quantity="5" unit="mile">5 miles</measure> before he overtook us. Before we got one big sail out the noon gun from <placeName ref="#The_Citadel">the Citadel</placeName> fired, and a dahabeah near us, flying the German flag, pulled out before us, however when we got out in the river and caught the wind we soon sailed past her, and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahommed Salah</persName> repeated his assurances that the <placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName> was the fastest boat on the river, and we found ourselves slipping rapidly past the dismal prison, <pb n="8"/> with its gangs of convicts chained to another at work on the bank, past the various palaces lining each side of the river - past the island of <placeName ref="#Rhoda">Rhoda</placeName> - past groves of palms - Arab villages - wastes of sand, until we pull up to take on board our belated sailor - here, the German boat which we have dubbed "<name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">The Flying Dutchman</name>" overtook us and passed, but we soon caught up with her, left her behind and lost sight of her, until one of our small boats which we carry behind containing our poultry yard of chickens and pigeons, came to grief in some way, and was overturned, and all the poor fowls drowned. I was sorry for <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName>, it being such a loss to his larder - but he took it with the stoical submission of a true Mahommedan. Again we had to pull up - catch the boat and right it - some of the fowls not being dead, we were astonished to see them throw overboard all of those just drowned, as it seemed they would prove most welcome food at least to the sailors, who so rarely get the opportunity to eat meat - but we learned that the <orgName ref="#Mahommedans">Mahommedans</orgName> will not eat meat that is not killed and bled. Again the <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name> passed us. The wind increased very much, and blew hard and strong, and we flew along at the rate of <measure quantity="6" unit="mile">six miles</measure> an hour against the current, thus verifying the character of the <placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName>. We passed <placeName ref="#Hulwan">Helouan</placeName> in the distance, a fashionable health resort, and through a dip in the <placeName ref="#Mokattam_Hills">Mokattam hills</placeName>, caught a last glimpse of the slender minarets of <placeName ref="#The_Citadel">the Citadel</placeName>. We passed <placeName ref="#Al_Badrashayn">Bedrashyn</placeName> where one of <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s boats was lying on its way up the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName>, with dozens of white helmetted tourists just returned from <placeName ref="#Memphis">Memphis</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName>. Then all the <placeName ref="#Pyramids">Pyramids</placeName> began to unfold themselves to our delighted eyes - first those of <pb n="9"/> <placeName ref="#Giza">Ghizeh</placeName> - then the <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName> group with its stepped pyramid - the blunted outline of <placeName ref="#Abu_Sir">Aboesir</placeName>, then <placeName ref="#Dahshūr">Dashoor</placeName> with its strange curving side, then <placeName ref="#Meidum">Meydoum</placeName> with its three shelved pyramid. A lovely sunset finished the bright day, so full of novelty and pleasure - and the young moon about 5 days old made the night, when it had descended, brilliant.</p>
        <p>Our first dinner was a great success - the table very pretty with its candles, and the white, green and gold china. We had been told of the prowess of our cook - and here was a luxurious dinner, admirably cooked, worthy of a chef - we all exclaimed that if we were going to live in this manner for two months we would go off of the dahabeah a party of hopeless dyspeptics. We played a game of cribbage after dinner, and late in the evening, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName> came in saying that we were just overtaking the <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name>, and we rushed on deck to see her lights as we flew past her. I went to bed with great comfort in my big state room, and the last sound I heard was <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> pacing the deck above me. The wind was so strong and favorable we continued sailing all night with the exception of an hour or two.</p>
        <p>This, Sunday morning, I was awakened about 7 o'clock by the stir of getting under way again. After our good breakfast we went on deck to enjoy the fascinating scene - but the light breeze soon increased almost to a gale - and I was first driven below, soon followed by the rest, quite blown to pieces. We had to take in one aft sail, and furl part of our glorious gib main sail, which with its great towering billowing white breast makes our <placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName> look like some living thing. It <pb n="10"/> was very exciting seeing the management of the boat, and the shifting of the big boom. After making splendid progress for some hours, the <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> thought it best to pull up under the lee of a high bank near <placeName ref="#Benisoef">Benisoef</placeName> - and here we stayed for 3 hours - the <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name> presently came tearing along and pulled into the bank also - but she only stayed to furl her big sail, and put up the small one, and was off again - but as we are not in a breathless hurry, we decided to wait for the wind to go down, so that we might sail in comfort. <placeName ref="#Benisoef">Benisoef</placeName> is <measure quantity="73" unit="mile">73 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName> says our run of 12 hours from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> here, is the best one he ever made, and he has been 20 years on the river. <persName ref="#Edwards_Amelia">Miss Edwards</persName> in "<orgName ref="#A_Thousand_Miles">A Thousand Miles</orgName>"" etc., says they took 10 days coming here, and were 3 days in getting away.</p>
        <p>I stayed below all the day - sitting in the cabin and staring through the windows at the strange, if not attractive scene beside us, of two boats loading with sugar cane - trains of camels coming down over the steep sandy bank and depositing it, and then scrambling back. A number of fellaheen soon made their appearance, and squatted down in the sand to look at us. A group of mother and two children fascinated me. The woman with the usual dark blue dress, dingy with dirt, her arms and neck and fingers covered with ornaments that looked as if they might be gold - the children with merest rags of garments, and covered with flies, hung about her like young animals - the smaller one standing nursing - and tugging at his mother's breast like a young calf. <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> went outside with some curiosity, and spoke Page 11: to them, but the woman's manner was rather threatening, and she moved away with her children. Two of the men had distaffs which they twirled diligently, making thread - above on the bank, beyond the forest of grandly waving palms, a mile or two away, lay the village of <placeName ref="#Benisoef">Benisoef</placeName>, with 10,000 inhabitants, and a sheik of its own. About 3 o'clock we pushed off, flying the merest little handkerchief of a sail with the wind lulled, and we went on under the big sail until about 8 o'clock, when the Captain sent word through <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName>, that he would like to tie up for the night - that there "was one big mountain" and the current bad. We were soon made fast to the bank - the crew had enclosed their deck with canvas - a lantern was swung, rugs and blankets taken out - and they gathered about the mutual supper bowl - afterwards taking out their curious drums and tambourines, and giving us our first concert, strange droning music in a minor key.</p>

        <p>The wind was so high last night, that we laid quietly by until an early hour this morning. After breakfast I went out on deck, and basked in the delicious sunlight, interested in everything I saw, until the wind became so strong I came below. Behind us we saw the sand storm coming, and our little aft sail is ordered to be furled - the waves are really high, the sand obscures the shore, and we are tearing along at a tremendous pace. I hear below the confusion above, the shouting of orders and shrieks of the wind, and it is very exciting - but we cannot stop, and not make any use of this wind, so we <pb n="12"/> keep on with a little rag of a sail, and at 12 o'clock pass <placeName ref="#Maghaghah">Magraghah</placeName>, <measure quantity="106" unit="mile">106 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, making this distance in two days, in spite of our frequent stopping. At one o'clock the <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">captain</persName> sent word that he would rather stop until the wind fell a little - which we were very glad to hear, as we were able to eat our lunch in peace. The sailors made us fast to the high black mud bank, and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName> reported a town not far off - but the sand was blowing so, that none of us had the courage to attempt walking. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> took to his stateroom for a sleep - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> clambered up the bank, and over it a little way, and came back with a bunch of mustard flowers, and some white clover blossoms, and a new and beautiful kind of grass. Numbers of lovely white and gray birds were flying about - much like our sand pipers. About 4 o'clock the wind fell and we pushed off, flying only the little sail from the felucca. I stayed down in the cabin all the afternoon perched up on one of the divans near a window, watching the shifting scenes on either side sometimes with a glass, of mud banks and villages, of palm fringed shores, of sterile sandy hills - the women eternally filling their water jugs, and walking off in stately grace, with these balanced on their heads - the storks standing about on their longs legs. Never shall I forget that picture I saw - a perfect silhouette against a clear yellow sunset sky - of a group streaming along the high bank - two or three women and children - a man on a donkey, with a child behind him - another young donkey full of life and pranks kicking up his heels behind him - then a dog and three or four sheep, all streaming along the narrow path - showing perfectly black against <pb n="13"/> the orange sky. Inside in our pretty cabin, was such perfect quiet and repose, the little kerosene stove that we bought at <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>'s suggestion in <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, and that has proved such a jewel, making a real fireside glow over everything - I threw myself down on the divan in a mood of deepest content, and fell asleep, until <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> came down half frozen from the upper deck; for we find the mornings and evenings really cold, and I find my fur cloak comfortable. I may now I think describe our dahabeah, and her belongings - in which we are so comfortable, that it is a delight to think it must last two months - and one wonders if it is possible that during that time we can ever become, after the manner of the average tiresome human being, weary of it, or find anything to complain of! We find the boat everything and more, than we expected - It is very clean, and in good order - the beds are delightfully comfortable, and all the arrangements are very good - my room, which occupies the stern, is really palatial, with its two beds, one of which we use for a lounge, its two big arm chairs, its chest of drawers with the mirror above, the little reading table at the head of my bed, and all the space, to say nothing of my nice little dressing room! The other staterooms, 3 in number are equally good, though smaller, and there is beside a room for <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahommed S</persName>. Our cabin, which serves as both dining room and sitting room, is about <measureGrp type="area" unit="feet"> <measure type="height" quantity="12">12</measure> x <measure type="width" quantity="15">15</measure> </measureGrp>, with a bookcase, two side boards with mirrors above, divans on each side, easy chairs etc. The prevailing color of all the fittings of the boat, is the "Prophet's" own - a bright grass green - an odious color to our ideas, but which has the merit of bright- <pb n="14"/> ness and cheerfulness - and there are besides, white linen covers for everything. Quite a pretty carpet with small figures in green and brown, covers all this part of the boat, and curtains and portiers and divans are covered with green silk brocade. We have decorated the cabin with some embroideries bought the other day at the <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> bazaar, and with some of our own things put about, we l ook very homelike. Beyond the cabin are the pantries and dragoman's room, and from the hall between, you go up three steps to the level of the lower deck - where the crew live and sleep, and wash and iron, and bake and brew - and in the lockers under which all their belongings, and many of our stores are kept. Near the end of this deck rises the main mast, carrying its great boom - and beyond this, the tiniest and most wonderful little kitchen that can be imagined - with blue and white tiles - and the wonder is, how all the delicious and skillful dishes that we make way with from morning to night can be concocted in that little place. The upper deck is reached by two narrow stair cases or gangways, from the lower deck - but before mounting those stairs I must not omit a description of the crew's kitchen - which consists of a stove just big enough to hold a soup pot, and it stands just to one side of the main mast - the little cook who presides over this is an Arab boy I should think of fourteen years - besides being cook for the crew, he is generally useful I see - and is ready to fetch and carry to any one's call - and is the sailor who climbs up to the extreme length of the big boom - and looks very much when he is there <pb n="15"/> like a large black fly. The greater part of the upper deck forms our principal sitting room, and is gay and comfortable with the handsome rugs <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought at the <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> bazaar the other day, and has two cushioned sofas with big pillows, a table and easy chairs - the stern part of the deck is sacred to the steersman, who with the <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> sleeps there. Behind the dahabeah we carry in our wake two small boats - the felucca as the one for our use is called, and another as I said before, in which we carry our live stock - and in the early morning I get the benefit in my room, of the dispirited crows and cackling of the imprisoned fowls. Our crew consists of our captain or <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais</persName>, who is always sitting or standing at the head of one of the gangways - he wears a long black gown which drags on the ground, and the big loose sleeves of which fall over his hands - a red tarboosh, with a white embroidered scarf wound round it as a turban, and is distinguished by his white woolen stockings and red leather shoes, these last I fancy being assumed for dignity or appearance, as I have come across him again and again in his moments of unbending and relaxation and have invariably surprised him with his shoes set side by side in a formal manner near his feet. In the cool of the morning and evening he ties a soft white woolen shawl about his head and shoulders, and looks from the rear like some respectable old lady going out to spend the afternoon in cloak and hood. He is a Nubian - oldish - quite black, or bronze rather - has a very quiet and watchful manner, is never excited - and <pb n="16"/> rules his crew with much quiet decision. He can say "good morning" and a few other words in English, but is very shy of it. He has a most powerful looking fellow for Steersman or Second Captain, and 10 sailors, mostly Nubians, who all seemed to me at first to look exactly alike, but who are now beginning to assume some individual features - but I still wonder if I shall ever know them by name, or distinguish them apart. They all seem gentle, patient fellows and when I go out they all spring to give me a helping hand up the stairs, and I am sustained to the very top by three or four of them, and then <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahommed Salah</persName> or the <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> receive me from their hands as if I were an imbecile. It is too absurd - but I endure it because I fear if I protest against it I will be misunderstood. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> indulge in much raillery on the subject. Then there is our cook - a middle aged fine looking <orgName ref="#Copts">Copt</orgName>, <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Hannah Ibraim</persName> by name, to whom we owe so many comforts - he is assisted by what <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. S.</persName> calls a "cook maid", a black fellow in red fez and yellow cotton gown. Then comes the indoor servants - <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName>, a cousin of <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed S.</persName>'s in regulation dragomans dress, who though an honest fellow, seems the only stupid disagreeable man on board, and his assistant, another of the innumerable Mahommeds, who is one of our laundresses - as well as chambermaid - and over all, our faithful <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahommed Salah</persName>. This is our personnel.</p>

        <p>A soft and brilliant morning sun shone into the windows of <pb n="17"/> my room and dressing room - and the glimpses of the lovely shores on either side kept me a long time dressing. After breakfast we all went up stairs and stayed until lunch was ready - it was a most delicious morning until about 11 o'clock the wind grew very strong bringing the sand with it, and again we had to sail under the small felucca sail. We passed <placeName ref="#Gebel_et_Sayr">Gebel-et-Sayr</placeName> (the mountain of birds) with its lovely palm groves, and <placeName ref="#Coptic_Convent">Coptic Convent</placeName>, and desolate frowning cliffs - and two wretched fellows ran along the bank, clamouring for baksheesh, and shouting that they were Christians like ourselves, and dropping their fluttering rags, plunged into the water and swam to the boat, and were starting to climb up, when <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> - who is strong on the decencies of life, yelled and shouted after them and made them drop back into the cold water - not however until they had secured in their mouths, the <measure type="currency">two shillings</measure> <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> gave them. We passed <placeName ref="#Al_Minya">Minieh</placeName> about 2 o'clock - making <measure quantity="156" unit="mile">156 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> in 3 days - a very remarkable run. Opposite <placeName ref="#Al_Minya">Minieh</placeName>, were moored four dahabeahs, three of them flying the American flag, and the fourth, the Union Jack. They had all left <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> some days before us. Our <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais</persName> talked of stopping for again there was "one big mountain" and difficult bends and currents - but we urged him on, and as the others were making ready to sail, we did not stop. The wind continued high, and all the rest of the afternoon the five boats were streaming along the great bends of the river here, more or less together, forming a pretty spectacle. This evening we are all lying one behind another about <measure quantity="4" unit="mile">4 miles</measure> from <persName ref="#Hassan_Beni">Beni Hassan</persName>. I have been on Page 18: deck for a few minutes - a radiant moon in a cloudless sky is shining down on this strange scene - the stars are brilliant - Orion striding right across the heaven above us. Crouched around a fire of corn stalks on the bank, is our guard sent from the town, of four men - for this is a dangerous neighborhood - they are smoking and talking in a low voice, and I see the gleaming of the moonlight on the barrels of their rifles. The lights from the other boats behind us, and their watch fires and smoking guards, made quite a scene against this desolate coast. There was much visiting between the crews - and the drumming, and tinkling of the tambourines, and the singing, made quite a gayety. This is the last day of the old year!</p>

        <p>While dressing this morning, I saw quite a concourse of men, children and donkeys gathered on the bank before us, who had supposed that we must be intending to visit the grotto tombs of <persName ref="#Hassan_Beni">Beni Hassan</persName> - but we have decided to leave these until we come down. Several of the children were holding up curious little things, which I did not at first recognize as mummied cats. Some of them were comically like, and I sent <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> to tell <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M. Salah</persName> to buy, which he did, for <measure type="currency">half a franc</measure> apiece! They smelled so loud, that I begged <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> to stow them away somewhere for me. I found the side-board graced by a remarkable structure of cake and sweetmeats, which the cook had compounded the night before, in honor of our <date when="1890-01-01">New Years Day</date>. Our greetings from the <pb n="19"/> crew and from all the men were most hearty - some of them being able to say a word or two in English - and they broke into a ringing shout when <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> announced that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> would give them a sheep on our arrival at <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> - and gave him in return something like a three times three. It is the custom during the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> voyage to give the sailors a sheep on three or four occasions. It means a great deal to them, and is probably the only time in the year when they get any meat to eat. They are such gentle patient people - working so cheerfully from morning to night - their wants are few, and their habits simple - they eat little, of the most simple food - about four times in the day - and each meal is invariably like every other, with the exception that sometimes a few raw onions are taken with it, or two or three leaves of a coarse kind of salad. Their food is a coarse bread cut in slices, and dried in the sun for days, until it is quite brown, when it is broken up and mixed with a soup of lentils - and they eat it from one big wooden bowl, with spoons, about which they all gather squatting on their haunches. If one of them wants a drink, he leans over the side of the boat and scoops up a tin full of water - they generally wash their hands after eating, and many of them rinse their mouths. After their last meal of the day they smoke a pipe called hubble-bubble - one pipe serving for all, and handed from one person to another. Then they get out their drums and tambourines and sing, until one after the other rolls himself in his blanket, somewhere on the deck for the night. It seems a hard life - and what these poor <pb n="20"/> folk must think of the endless variety of dishes they daily see carried into our cabin, and the countless things that are necessary to our comfort, I cannot imagine. We have had a magnificent sailing wind all day - indeed it was sometimes too strong. Again I took refuge in our bright, comfortable cabin until late in the afternoon when the wind having fallen, I went on deck for an hour before sunset - it was deliciously calm and beautiful - a number of working boats all along the river, with their picturesque loads of Arabs and merchandises. We landed for the night just before dusk, and the rest went for a walk along the shore, and came in late for dinner. We have made today about <measure quantity="30" unit="mile">30 miles</measure>. We have passed <placeName ref="#Rhoda">Rhodah</placeName>, where the <persName ref="#Pasha_Isma'il">Khedive</persName> has extensive sugar factories - and <placeName ref="#Amarna">Tel-Amarna</placeName> where there are grotto tombs of great interest, belonging to the <date from="-1549" to="-1292">18th Dynasty</date> - and are now just approaching the great chain of mountains which stretch precipitously along the east bank of the river for <measure quantity="10" unit="mile">10</measure> - <measure quantity="12" unit="mile">12 miles</measure> - known as <placeName ref="#Abu_Fudah_Jabal">Gebel Abou-Faydak</placeName>.</p>

        <p>The thermometer this morning at 8:30 marked <measure type="temperature">49&#186;</measure> - and it seemed to me it might be even colder, so cold was it in my room when I wakened, in spite of the glow from the little stove. The sky was overcast with clouds too. I sat shivering in the cabin after breakfast for an hour, then the sun coming out I went up on deck. If it had been possible to have escaped the wind the sun would have been too hot. The wind failed however after a time, and the men took to polling, and <pb n="21"/> later to tracking. Late in the afternoon a good breeze carried us on our way into the evening, when we struck a sand bank, but soon got away, and anchored in mid river for the night. All day we have been passing the great cliffs of the <placeName ref="#Abu_Fudah_Jabal">Gebel Aboufaydah</placeName> chain - at <placeName ref="#Manfalût">Manfalout</placeName> they rise abruptly from the water. These limestone cliffs, like all the long range almost unbroken that has followed us from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, are honey combed with tombs that look like little caves. I have been putting out my eyes staring at them through the glass. I could make out two or three real portals, and occasionally a pillar or rough paintings - sometimes men could be seen on the face of the cliffs, quarrying stones. We are about <measure quantity="11" unit="mile">11 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName>.</p>

        <p>This morning was bright and beautiful - yet the thermometer marked <measure type="temperature">45&#186;</measure>. We found ourselves opposite the southern extremity of the <placeName ref="#Abu_Fudah_Jabal">Gebel Aboufaydah</placeName> range - where are situated the famous <placeName ref="#Grottoes_of_Maabdeh">grottoes of Maabdeh</placeName> - filled with thousands and thousands of mummied crocodiles - and some human mummies, which are decorated most richly. I hear that these caves have been very little explored. The cliffs of this range used to be the favorite resort of crocodiles - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> has been on the alert, for she <hi rend="underline">intends</hi> to see a crocodile frequently - though they have not been seen for years below <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. The steamers, and the tourists with their guns have frightened them all away.</p>
        <p><pb n="22"/>	The river makes some great bends here, and it was tedious even in the fair wind we had for we see the minarets of <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName>, now here now there, and we never seemed to come nearer, until at last we left the cliffs, and were approaching <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> - a large important town of 30,000 inhabitants, and the terminus of the railway from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. It is <measure quantity="250" unit="mile">250 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, and we have made the distance in the extraordinary time of 6 days - and we sing aloud our praises of the "<placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName>". The landing place is gay as we pull up to it, with two <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cooks</orgName> steamers, with their red flags and pennants - and several dahabeahs. We were no sooner fast, than the donkeys and donkey boys began to assemble themselves together, ready to pounce upon their prey - for, whenever a dahabeah is seen approaching the news immediately spreads - and every man who has a donkey to ride, or a fowl or sheep or eggs or whatnot to sell, hastens with them to the landing. When the saddles were brought out of the hold on the lower deck, they made for us, and even invaded the deck, and attempted to seize the saddles. Our crew were not enough for them, and it took <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and Gens d'armes with their sticks to keep them in order. While <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> was selecting the donkeys, and the saddles were being put on, there was a dire confusion of yells and blows - but the choice being once made sudden peace fell - and the disappointed ones decamped quietly enough. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> had caused a chair to be especially constructed for me before we left <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> (of which he is immensely proud) should riding be too hard for me. I have felt very dubious about this chair from the first, and when four of our men marched <pb n="23"/> off with it, I must say it gave us the air of a funeral cortige. I got bravely upon a donkey, and the men with the chair struck across the fields to the town, to be in reserve for me, and we started for the town <measure quantity="3" unit="mile">3 miles</measure> away, for some distance riding between the R.R. tracks, then on a fine high road past some beautiful gardens and pretentious houses, and entered the outskirts of the town - which generally had all the wretched features of the usual eastern town - squalor and dirt and misery - the sightless eyes - the filthy children - the men squatting or lying in heaps of rags against the walls. The bazaar was the most interesting one I had seen, in its general features. We stopped at one of the boutiques, and bargained for some of the frail but pretty pottery for which <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> is famous. I was very anxious to replace as exactly as possible the pretty black coffee pot dear <persName ref="#Freudenberg_Annie">Annie Freudenberg</persName> brought me from here years ago - but I could see nothing like it. When we were almost through the bazaar <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> who seemed to think I was neglecting his chair, proposed that I should get in it, which I did; but instead of being carried by the poles, as in the ordinary chaise-&#224;-porteur, I was raised aloft, and the handles were borne on their shoulders! to the great amusement of the rest of our party, and the consternation of the crowded bazaar, who fell away before me as if I were an eastern potentate, or the Queen of Sheba. Our men were delighted, as they always enjoy a show of dignity in those they serve - and I felt like the car of Juggernaut as they swept the crowd from my path, and when I saw them spinning a poor blind man almost off his feet, I could ******** (? MISSING PAGE?) <pb n="24"/> upon these people, in their manner of living and thinking.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Anderson_Mr">Mr Anderson</persName> seemed an intelligent, sensible man, with pleasant manners - and <persName ref="#Anderson_Mrs">Mrs. A</persName>'s fresh complexion did not seem to have suffered anything from her 15 years residence in this climate. They have 5 bright, healthy looking children. The big lofty room - with its homely decorations - its American stove, its prints of <persName ref="#Washington_George">George</persName> and <persName ref="#Washington_Martha">Martha Washington</persName> - the <orgName ref="#Bible">Bible</orgName> texts framed and hung about the room, and a sewing machine piled high with half finished little frocks, all told of housewifely care and order, and seemed such a domestic, wholesome bit in that eastern environment, that it pleased me much. We bought a <orgName ref="#Bible">Bible</orgName>, for we have only a french one with us, and promising to call on our way down the river, we said goodbye, and mounted our donkeys, turning our faces homeward. Meeting a stream of tourists walking and riding, and we concluded <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s' new steamer the "<name type="boat" ref="#Rameses">Rameses</name>"" had arrived - and on reaching the river bank we found the landing below crowded. I was glad to dismount from the wise looking little "<persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mahomet Ali</persName>" I had been riding all the afternoon, through the wind and the dust, and reach the quiet of our bright little cabin and the comfort of hot water and brushes. <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName> had the tea table ready, and the smoking Samovar and a loaf of fresh plum cake looked inviting. Just as we began taking our tea <persName ref="#Stauring_General">General Stauring</persName> and his party came in from the <name type="boat" ref="#Rameses">Rameses</name>, and were loud in praise of the comfort and homelike air of our dahabeah - and made many a complaint of their fellow passengers on the steamer. In the evening we amused ourselves looking at our pretty jars, and <pb n="25"/> congratulated ourselves that we were not "Cookites", and we decided to push on in the morning, if this strong wind holds - and leave the rest of <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> for our return. The tombs on the mountains are not very much, but the view from there is said to be one of the finest in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>.

        <p>A grey day with little sunshine, and much cold wind. I did not once go on deck - and spent much of the day in reading the piles of newspapers that came by mail to us yesterday. We have made a splendid run, and are yet sailing, and expect to make <measure quantity="50" unit="mile">50 miles</measure> before we stop for the night. The almost unbroken mountain chain on the east bank continues its limestone stata almost perfectly level, and its sky line equally so. In places the river has scooped itself a great bend around the vast sand banks it has deposited - and we leave the mountains only to come back almost to the same place, after hours of sailing - along the low sand banks are troops and troops of birds - about which no one can give me information. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> calls them all eagles when I ask him. I stare at them through the glass, and enjoy the spectacle. The vultures are the funniest things - sitting in solemn rows - and looking too ridiculous - and the storks standing about on one of their long legs, and a strange heavy looking fowl, brown and black, with a small head and wide spreading wings - and everywhere the cheer- <pb n="26"/> ful little water wag-tail - who invade our decks - sit about on the ropes, and complain to us that we give them nothing to eat - occasionally one will hop along the rugs, directly to our feet.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon hearing a stir outside, I got up from my divan where I was having a little siesta, and saw a group of running scrambling children, and a dog, running along the bank to which we were very close, to whom <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and the men were throwing bread and apples and such a rough and tumble scramble as it was! One little fellow was the veriest bundle of rags ever seen - his naked body showing through everywhere - how he could keep them on was a mystery - one boy had not even a rag, and was ready to plunge into the water any moment, if the prize failed to reach the shore. The other boy was deterred I suppose from the fear of spoiling his clothes! The dog got the greater share, which the children took good naturedly - In the evening as the full moon was shining resplendently, we came close to the lofty cliffs of <placeName ref="#Gebel_Harêdi">Gebel Sheykh Her&#233;edee</placeName>, in some places rising abruptly from the water. Just at the bend of the river, was a narrow strip of land, crowded with great palm trees - making a most enchanting scene - and here about 8 o'clock, we tied up for a time, waiting for the wind to lull, before we attempted passing this "one big mountain". <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> reports this part of the river very dangerous, because of the thieves and lawless inhabitants of the country - and tells a thrilling story, which we heard ourselves in <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> yesterday, how a few days ago, a lot of them went into that town, robbing and killing 3 or 4 men. <pb n="27"/></p>

        <p>We have had our first adventure! The night being so fine, we sailed late - and I had been roused by the noise made over my head by the sailors, and for a long time could not sleep - and lying half awake, I was suddenly roused by an unusual noise in the water like something rushing close to us, and a little bump. After considering whether I should get up and call <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>, I decided at least to light my candle, and in the same moment I heard the steersman above me jump up with a warning shout, and instantly there was a babel of voices and cries. When I got my door open, I found <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> just coming out of his room in his bathing gown, and saw <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> rushing out on the deck with his revolver. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> stopped to get into an ulster, and followed him. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> appeared from their rooms and we breathlessly awaited developments. Three shots fired hastily sounded very alarming at that time of night, but it turned out that no one at least on our boat was hurt. The steersman discovered a boat crowded with Arabs stealing close to us - and I clearly heard her touch. When the alarm was given, and all our men showed themselves, and demanded as I suppose in choice Arabic expletives what they meant, they pulled hastily away, and declared they had mistaken us for an Arab boat, which they wished to board. A flimsy excuse so <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> thought, and so sent three shots from his revolver after them. It took us some little time to compose ourselves, though <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> made light of it, and seemed to think the men had been easily alarmed. But I think they know <pb n="28"/> their own country better than we do - and the reports of the turbulent state of this part of the country would seem to be true, after the occurrence at <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> the other day. At any rate <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I prefer to think that the blood thirsty villains wanted our money and our lives, and that we made a narrow escape!</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> gave orders to stop at the first good ground, and we pulled up about 1 o'c. and I fancy a double watch was kept for the rest of the night.</p>
        <p>All day long we have been spanking along before the high wind. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> continually exchanging compliments on the fine sailing qualities of the "Nubia". The villages are growing very picturesque. We have passed several large populous towns - <placeName ref="#Sohag">Sohag</placeName>, with a population of 8700 - with mosques and minarets - and <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Girgeh</placeName>, with a lovely minaret. All of these towns are built on the site of, or near ancient ruins and tombs, most interesting to an archaeologist. They all have the most singular buildings or towers, which are really pigeon houses - and the pigeons in this part of the country must be numbered by millions. These towns are lofty - somewhat pyramidal in shape, and have very curious rounded looking battlements, each one of which is a pigeon house. Very often, these towers surmount the houses - and dried twigs and branches are fastened on their sides, for convenient roosting places. I have often seen them in photographs, but could never discover what they were. These pigeons are not for eating, and no one is allowed I believe to kill them. They are kept for their manure, which is <pb n="29"/> carefully collected, dried and pressed into flat cakes, and used for fuel, and is very valuable. We had another incident this afternoon - one of the men fell overboard from the boom, they say he was not hurt, but he got an unexpected bath. I opened the door to see what the matter was, and found him just scrambling on the boat again - and he began to take off his clothes so rapidly, that I did not stop to make inquiries. We passed on the east a chain of hills that came down close to the river, known as <placeName ref="#Gebel_Tookh">Gebel Tookh</placeName> - when I first noticed them we were just at their base - and looking up their lofty slope the sky above them was of the softest and most exquisite deep purple blue - the little strip of water dividing us from the cliff was almost as blue - nothing but these two pure shades to be seen - the blue, and the soft yellow of the limestone hills! and their conformation was so remarkable. I longed for a geologist to tell me about them. They bore evident marks of running water, and were worn into great rounded bastions and buttresses and clustered pillars - and over all, cropping out over the limestone strata is a curious looking stalactite formation. We brought up at <placeName ref="#Balliana">Balliana</placeName> for the night, having made <measure quantity="56" unit="mile">56 miles</measure> since morning! This is the place from which <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos</placeName> is visited - but we defer this until we come down.</p>

        <p>We put off from <placeName ref="#Balliana">Ballianeh</placeName> very early yesterday morning in a fine wind - but it grew lighter and lighter until about 1 o'clock we were left "a painted ship" upon the water. Then we wished we had <pb n="30"/> given the day to <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos</placeName>. The wind not only gave out for a time, but veered to the south, and we had to throw out an anchor. We caught up and passed the <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name>, however, before this, and have kept each other in sight ever since - for today has been much like yesterday with only less wind - and what with tracking and polling, we have only made <measure quantity="5" unit="mile">5 miles</measure>, whereas yesterday we made <measure quantity="26" unit="mile">26</measure>. The day has been delicious really hot - and we had up an awning for the first time, and I doffed my fur cloak. The river was a mirror - and from every direction came the melancholy cry of the shadoof workers. The shores are lined with shadoofs - which are simple appliances for raising the water of the river to the level of irrigation. Two poles are set up, four or five feet apart, and several feet above the river - on a cross pole between these is balanced a long pole, weighted at one end by a large mass of dried mud, and from the other is suspended a bucket made of skin or leather. If the river is low, two or three of these are placed one above the other - at each level a basin is scooped out for the reception of the water, and below it stands a man who sinks the bucket in the water, where it is filled, then letting go of it the weight at the other end lifts the bucket of water, which is received by a man on the next level, who empties it either into the irrigating ditch, or into the receptacle above for water. The men are generally naked, except for a cloth about the loins, and look like dripping bronze statues, and they have a peculiar cry as they work, consisting of 3 or 4 notes which we find impossible to get, in a minor key with a peculiar quaver, and the effect is desolate and melancholy in the extreme <pb n="31"/> and seems the hopeless expression of their joyless and hopeless lives. In the quiet of the evening, it is especially sad, and when the land is at all well cultivated, the shadoofs are only a few yards apart. What an important part the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> plays in this strange country! aside from its supplying the soil, and being the sole means of cultivation, its mud is so useful - they make their pots and dishes of it, build their houses and fences of it - the upright poles of the shadoofs are generally made of bunches of corn stalk about which the mud is moulded, and soon baked hard and dry in the sun - they use it for mortar and plaster, and it takes the place of wood in dozens of ways.</p>

        <p>We started very early this morning polling - and the men making such a noise from necessity, that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> gave orders there should be no more polling before 7 o'clock. In spite of light winds and dead calms, we reached <placeName ref="#Keneh">Keneh</placeName> (<measure quantity="405" unit="mile">405 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>) about 2 o'clock. We landed opposite the town, and took donkeys for <placeName ref="#Dandarah">Denderah</placeName>, half an hours ride away. We crossed the fields "sans ceremonie" - riding over patches of young onions and wheat, crossed the dry bed of a canal, and then followed a little path across pleasant fields. O! how charming it was as we all streamed along there! the bright day - the fragrant air, the strange country - and actually, before my eyes at last, an Egyptian Temple! I knew it from prints and photographs, but as we drew near it, the stupendous fa&#231;ade and gloomy portal, with vistas of enormous, closely set pillars, with their heavy fantastic capitals of Hathor heads, <pb n="32"/> was sufficiently impressive. I will not attempt any description of it, for I can always find a better one to read than I could write. It is one of the most important and best preserved of the Temples - and the newest. It was begun by <persName ref="#Ptolemy_XI">Ptolemy XI</persName>, and finished under <persName ref="#Tiberius">Tiberius</persName> and <persName ref="#Nero">Nero</persName>. <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Marriette Bey</persName> says "Jesus Christ was living in <placeName ref="#Jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName> when this temple was being completed" and he gives an admirable description of it, and of the allegorical sentiment shown by the sculptures and paintings. We walked about those great halls with their mighty columns like a handful of pigmies, looking at the pictures and reliefs that cover the surface of each wall and column - with here and there the colors still showing. Then climbed the processional stairs, which received only an occasional shaft of light through a square opening in the enormously thick walls. Our guides carried lighted candles, not only that we might see the unbroken line of incised inscriptions and pictures which covered every surface of the dark walls, but that we might see where we were putting our feet, and it gave one a strange sensation to see that in this <hi rend="underline">newest</hi> of Egyptian temples, these solid shallow steps were worn in the middle to a smooth level! We came out at last upon the terrace or roof of the temple, where we found a beautiful little hypaethral temple with 12 columns, dedicated to <persName ref="#Osiris">Osiris</persName>. Then we clambered to the top of the cornice, and sat down to rest and talk - and read our books of description. We could look down upon the ruins of the great enclosing wall of bricks, that always surrounded an Egyptian Temple, to conceal its mysteries - The stones forming the roof <pb n="33"/> of the temple, raised a few feet above the level of the terrace were enormous - astounding. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName>, after we had descended, went down into the crypt. I had no curiosity for this, even had I been able to climb down those huge steps from <measure quantity="4" unit="feet">4</measure> to <measure quantity="5" unit="feet">5 feet</measure> high. After they had disappeared there came swarming from the black chasm of a staircase, troops of bats, disturbed by the lights the men were carrying. Our ride home at that hour would have been charming, had it not been for the procession of children, some of them such wee little things, who followed us home to the dahabeah, and would not be shaken off. They pattered along in their little bare feet, running and tumbling over one another, and crying in their pleasant voices, <hi rend="underline">Baksheesh</hi>, <hi rend="underline">baksheesh</hi>, and holding in their hands for sale everything, from a stalk of mustard in flower, to nuts from the dom palm, and spurious antiques. It was a piteous thing to see that two men over whose crops we were riding and walking, should rush along protesting violently, not at us, but at the poor little bare feet that were hurrying along with us.</p>

        <p><pb n="34"/>Again a day of little wind, and with all the effort we could make, we are only anchored tonight about <measure quantity="12" unit="mile">12 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> - with the big American tied up just behind us, we having succeeded in passing her today as she was stuck on a sand bank. The <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name> too, is just ahead of us. This morning, as we were lying by a high bank with a luxuriant grove of palm trees, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> went off for a walk, <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> established herself on the bank to finish the sketch of the dahabeah begun several days ago - and I and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> escorted by one of our men carrying a long pole, without which an Arab does not seem able to walk, clambered up the bank for a little stroll. I wanted the pleasure of wandering among the palms, which did not prove all I had hoped for, as all the space between the trees was thick dust. We picked a few unknown flowers, and saw an Egyptian scarab, a large handsome shining black fellow, not engaged in the traditional exercise of rolling his ball of eggs up the bank, as I would have preferred, but foolishly basking in the sun on a dry branch. <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> called him a "b&#234;te" and looked at him with much disgust - but I explained that he was a very celebrated character. We met a lot of women and children and they all put out their hands and said "<hi rend="underline">Backsheesh</hi> Hawajis" - the women all seem to have such very sweet pleasant voices. We had got home and were sitting under the awning of the upper deck, when we noticed a little procession coming along the bank - a dignified man riding a donkey, preceeded by several men carrying rifles, and follow- <pb n="35"/> ed by others. We were astonished to see <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> stride hastily up the bank, and the man alight at once, and the two went through some ceremonious formalities, then fell upon each other's necks in a truly patriarchial fashion. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> then brought him down to the boat, where he was received with much respect by the men - some of the sailors raising his robe to kiss. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> then came to us and explained that he was the <persName ref="#Bey_of_the_Ababdehs_Sheik">Sheik bey of the Ababdehs</persName>, an important tribe of the <orgName ref="#Busharin_Bedouins">Bedouins</orgName>, and had control of all the country between the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Red_Sea">Red Sea</placeName>. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> told <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> to bring him up to us. He was a grave, kindly splendid looking middle aged man. He merely touched each of us by the hand, and then carried his hand to his forehead, then to his heart, and sat down on one of the divans, and we made a little slow conversation with <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> as interpreter. But conversation in the East is not considered a necessary adjunct to a visit, or one of the duties of hospitality, and I suppose an Oriental would pronounce the rattling nothings we exchange with one another when we visit, the height of bad manners and vulgarity. It takes a well bred person I always think to sit through an awkward silence with composure, and with no evident effort to think of what to say, and I admired the calm placidity of our guest, and felt that my unconscious mental efforts to cast about for something to say, were very undignified. We had coffee served and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> gave him a cigarette. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> showed him her sketch book in which he seemed interested, and when he saw the excellent sketch of <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed</persName> so like, he broke into a broad smile, showing all his white teeth. I told <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> to say to him <pb n="36"/> that I had read a great deal about the <orgName ref="#Busharin_Bedouins">Bedouins</orgName> and their desert, and wanted very much to make the journey across it, then he bowed and touched his forehead and the region of his heart with inimitable grace and dignity, and said something to the effect, that the desert, and he, and his tribe were at my disposal, when I should arrange to go, and that he hoped very soon etc. etc. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> photographed him, after asking his permission. And then he said that among his men, he had one of another tribe, that of the <orgName ref="#Busharin_Bedouins">Busharin</orgName>, and he was fetched to be photographed - which he evidently enjoyed, his black little eyes taking in everything with much curiosity - he was of low stature, with a great many yellow white rags hanging about him, quite black, with hair in small thick curls. Finally the <persName ref="#Bey_of_the_Ababdehs_Sheik">Sheik</persName> went away across the river in his boat, as, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> explained he had a case to try of some "steal people" on the other side of the river.</p>

        <p>This morning after almost a dead calm for two or three hours, the wind freshened and we were approaching <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, lying on the eastern bank, looking very gay with the flags of the different consulates flying from their respective buildings. The crew had got out their drums and tambourines, and were singing and drumming as they always do when we pull up to a place of any importance. Flags were fluttering too from several dahabeahs, and a <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s steamer. As we passed a dahabeah with the stars and stripes at the mast, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> fired two salutes, which <pb n="37"/> were answered by her, and a salute from the <orgName ref="#American_Consulate">American Consulate</orgName> which we returned, so that we made a proper sensation as we moved to our mooring ground, just beyond the <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor Hotel</name> - we were soon in the felucca, and the man pulling us to the music of their songs, to the Post Office, where we got our mail, and then went to the great temple, at whose beautiful columns we had been staring as we passed. It was begun by <persName ref="#Amenhotep_III">Amenophis III</persName> (<date when="-1703">1703 B.C.</date>) and completed by <persName ref="#Rameses_II">Ramsis II</persName>, the irregular colonnades with their singular heavy papyrus columns belongs to the older part. Nothing of great interest about it - it is choked and emcumbered with modern erectures - a mosque, and a bevy of Arab mud houses. <persName ref="#Champollion_Jean">Champollion</persName> or <persName ref="#Rosellini">Rosellini</persName> lived in one of these in <date when="1829">1829</date>, and later it was inhabited by <persName ref="#Duff_Gordon_Lady">Lady Duff Gordon</persName>, who spent the last years of her life here - and very sad years they must have, been so far from her home, and husband and children - they must have been full of kindness and usefullness to those around her, and <persName ref="#Edwards_Amelia">Miss Edwards</persName> says, Every Arab in <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> cherishes her memory in his heart of hearts, and speaks of her with blessings. We paid a short visit to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor Hotel</name>, to see how far it bore out the praises lavished upon it by <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s pamphlets. The entrance gate is near the landing and we walked through a pleasant avenue of Scent trees, their pretty little tufted yellow flowers making the air fragrant with their delicate perfume. The house looked very attractive and especially the newer portion now occupied by the <persName ref="#Nikolaevich_Peter">Grand Duke Peter</persName> of <placeName ref="#Russia">Russia</placeName> and his suite <pb n="38"/> - and he sat reading on one of the low balconies. The house is built of <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> bricks of mud, with enormously thick walls - and looked comfortable enough, though the rather English styles of everything contrasted strongly with the crude style of building. We sat down in the shade of the verandah to read our letters. I saw several sad faced invalids, walking slowly about the grounds - and a hideous stout old head of an Englishwoman, enveloped in furs, with gold chains and beads and bracelets and rings, sitting in a wheel chair. She was such a <hi rend="underline">type</hi>, that I wanted to sit down in front of her and think of her, and talk to her. On one of the low balustrades, was a huge pelican - a magnificent creature, quite tame, and most affectionately devoted to a young pointer dog, who returned the attentions most demonstrably, and it was very comical.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> then started for the tour of the town, and I and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> went back to the felucca, and were rowed most merrily home - and sat on deck watching with great amusement the purchases of <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> in the commisariat line - turkeys, pigeons and chickens, eggs and milk were arriving, and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and the cook were making their selections undisturbed by the babel of voices about them - but when the financial settlement came, it was something terrific - those who had not sold united their noisy gesticulations with those who had sold, but also had not got so much money as they demanded, our old hag beat her breast, and went through the motions at least of tearing her hair. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and <pb n="39"/> the <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Hannah Ibraim</persName>, our stately cook, coming quietly on board, with some of our men bringing on the purchases, was the signal for the breaking up of the market, a sudden peace fell, and they all went off chatting and smiling. There is always this scene on these occasions - they are never satisfied with any price they get - there is always this terrifying climax, from which they fall to quiet, cheerful acquiescence - and all depart apparently contented. Much of it comes no doubt, from the singular fatalistic submission of the <orgName ref="#Mahommedans">Mohammedan</orgName> - we have often noticed this feature in the <orgName ref="#Mahommedans">Mohammedans</orgName>.</p>

        <p>We made <measure quantity="5" unit="mile">5 miles</measure> last evening after leaving <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, before we tied up for the night. This morning was very overcast, and it seemed every moment that it would rain. The air was as quiet as the water which was glassy in its stillness. The men have been tracking and polling. In the afternoon we were passing <placeName ref="#Armant">Erment</placeName>, on the west side of the river, with an important sugar factory - and we saw little steam cars laden with coal, which looked extremely out of place with their environment of palm trees. The quite modern buildings of the town extend along the water side, thickly shaded by lubbek and <name type="plant" ref="#sycamore">sycamore</name> - and under one of the widely spreading hoary old sycamore trees, some kind of a court of Justice was sitting - actually squatting on the ground - such an assemblage of turbans, it was! <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> is the natural home of <pb n="40"/> the <name type="plant" ref="#sycamore">sycamore</name> - their leaves are smaller than with us however, and the foliage much more compact. I have seen numbers of splendid specimens, of which that one forming the roof of that Court of Justice was the finest. Some time after this the wind having freshened very much, and we making a merry progress, we suddenly brought up with a shiver against a sand bank. Such a commotion as followed I have not seen since our midnight adventure. Such cries, and boundings about on deck - and such struggles with the poles! Soon we were off, and wisely decided that as this part of the river is full of sand banks, we would pull up for the night, and here we are in profound stillness, with only the soft lapping of the water against our sides, to break it. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> told us of such an amusing little incident he met with in <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, he encountered a very small boy, who put out his very small hand and asked for baksheesh, saying: I am a poor man - I hold up my father and mother - I am glad to see you, how do you do? <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> of course could not resist this funny appeal, and gave him some money - when he said pleasantly "thank you, go to Hell". I fancy many idle tourists amuse themselves teaching English phrases, of not the choicest description to those poor little monkeys, and this is one of the results.</p>

        <p>Started with a light wind this morning, which soon failed, and in spite of the heat, the men took to tracking. The day has been entirely overcast, looking as if the rain might fall at any moment, <pb n="41"/> and giving an effect as of a natural law interfered with as if some strange power were preventing it. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> had a long walk on shore. At noon, we pulled up for an hour or two, to give the men a rest, and after luncheon started for <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName>, which had been in sight all the morning. About 5 o'clock we were slowly stealing by the town, to our mooring place beyond. The more modern part of the town looking quite attractive with some good houses, and many trees, the older part rising from the river in very irregular fashion, the clustered mud houses looking more like a huge wasp's nest, than anything else - and just the same color. It is built over the mounds of the ancient city of <placeName ref="#Letopolis">Letopolis</placeName> - the yawning apertures of which show that each innundation of the river, tumbles down a portion of it. As we sailed slowly along, we noticed a little tide of people from the town sitting in our wake, and by the time we pulled to shore on the banks of a flourishing green wheat field, we found a select audience squatted in a row in front of us, with new comers constantly arriving - some carried in their arms, turkeys and chickens, one brought a sheep, others, the pretty baskets made at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> and all the country about here - of which the fashion in shape and decoration has not changed since the days of the Pharaohs. One little black tot, about five years old, with remnants of a faded blue cotton gown hanging about his naked body, clutched so affectionately to him a sad, scrawney half-grown chicken, and every time I looked at him, he held up the poor thing by its wings, and grinned so anxiously at me, that I sent <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> out with a half piaster to give him, and to tell him <pb n="42"/> to take himself and his chicken home. This treatment was so effective that the next morning early, he was found squatting on the same spot, and hugging the same chicken, prepared to repeat his experience of the night before. <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName> is noted for its colony of <orgName ref="#Ghawazi"><choice>
                     <sic>Chewagi</sic>
                     <corr>Ghawazi</corr>
                  </choice></orgName>, or dancing girls - and many of them came trooping down to the boat as soon as we arrived. The poor things looked so horrid in their wretched finery and bedizennings. One of them a tall, thin, fine looking woman, with large eyes and pleasant face, came lightly down the path, with a graceful free carriage which reminded me not a little of <persName ref="#Terry_Ellen">Ellen Terry</persName>, holding up her gaudy cotton gown a little to display a pair of white ruffled drawers, closed about the ankle, which she evidently thought very much &#224; la mode, and greeted me with her pleasant voice, and a graceful bend of the head with, "good night, lady" - and turning to an Egyptian woman holding a baby, patted its cheek with affectionate gaiety, quite pretty to see. They are all disreputable women - and formed a great contrast to the other women, who, however ragged and dirty, always hold a part of their dress across the face, below the eyes. The sailors immediately began getting the boat in proper order for we are to lie here all day tomorrow, to give the sailors an opportunity for baking their new supply of bread - and for the first time the upper deck is enclosed with awnings, forming a charming appartment, which in the evening, lighted by our fine lantern, looked very pretty and festive. Everything at this hour is unusually quiet, most of the men having gone off - and their usual noisy drumming and singing is gratefully missed.</p>

It was cheerful and homelike to look down on the lower deck, lighted with its lantern, and enclosed with awnings. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName>, <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais Achmed</persName>, <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Cook Hanna</persName>, <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName>, and a gen d"armes from the town who had come in for a visit, were all squatting about in a social circle, with pipes and coffee and gossip, while the little deck cook <persName ref="#Benis">Benis</persName>, in his blue gown and white turban, hovered about them attending to their wants, being too young I suppose to be trusted to the gayeties of the town, to which all the sailors have cleared out. In the foreground stood our "house maid" <persName ref="#Mahmoud">Mahmoud</persName>, ironing clothes at a table - for we have had a great wash today - and I looked out on a very domestic scene from the cabin this morning. Just at the edge of the wheat, some of our poles were stuck in the ground, the ropes were stretched between, and such an amount of fluttering and drying linen. Two of the men were squatted on the ground, with two shallow tin tubs, like sponging tubs, and were washing. Our clothes seemed to awaken much interest, as I saw several of the men examining the strange garments - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>'s pajamas, with their gay stripes seemed especially attractive. A small boy was hired to watch them and protect them from the too curious touch of any outside the "family", and to look after our live stock, which had been turned out for a day afield. Four turkeys were picketed near the coop containing the pigeons and chickens and an unsuspecting young sheep nibbled at the green wheat, as if he <pb n="44"/> expected an eternity of such pleasant days. Soon after breakfast we got into the felucca, and were rowed down to the town, where a donkey was pressed into my service, and we went through the town and bazaar, the rest walking beside and around me. The town and the bazaar was as filthy and discouraging as those we have seen in every other mud town of <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>. The heat was great, and the flies thick. Then we went to the temple, which is more than half buried in the accumulated soil of centuries. <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mohemet Ali</persName> cleared out the hypostyle hall, for some kind of magazine - the rest of it lies buried under the modern village. It belongs to the Roman period - is built of sandstone, and even to my uneducated eye, showed poor and rough sculpture, the capitals however were varied and graceful in design, and delicate in execution.</p>
        <p>The afternoon and evening were very warm. We sat in our upstairs drawing room, the awnings raised on one side, and I never saw such stillness and repose as in the view we had before us. The river at <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName> is broad, and the low sand shores of the opposite side, with their fringe of <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palm trees</name> against the yellow cliffs beyond them, the unruffled water, all were the expression of perfect repose. During the evening the <name type="boat" ref="#Rameses">Ramesis</name> passed us, on her return trip.</p>

        <p>A warm morning, made for the first time our little stove unnecessary. We were off with a good wind early, and made a fine run to <placeName ref="#Idfu">Edfoo</placeName>, <measure quantity="32" unit="mile">32 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName>, which we passed at four o'clock in the <pb n="45"/> afternoon. We could plainly see the lofty pylons of the temple, which we are to visit on our downward journey - and, having made over <measure quantity="40" unit="mile">40 miles</measure>, brought up at dusk under a superb grove of palm trees, too late for a walk on shore, though <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">T.</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> tried it, coming back in a few minutes, reporting it very rough and dirty.</p>

        <p>We are now lying under some lofty <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name>, the wind driving against us, and the ruffled water rolling us from side to side. We have been sailing like a steam boat all day and have made a splendid run. It was very exciting watching our boat racing along, throwing the water from her sharp prow - the big sail so often shifted - and the men skipping about like cats. The captain and sailors are so proud of the record we have made that they put forward every effort and our sailing today has reflected great credit on <persName ref="#Rais_Achmed">Rais Achmed</persName>. Within two or three days we have entered the sandstone country. The steep yellow unbroken cliffs which follow the eastern bank of the river for hundreds of miles, have given way to broken irregular sandstone hills, and today the shores begin to show rocks. The river too has narrowed and the current is stronger, the valley of the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> too, is narrower, and the desert, often on both sides, has come down quite close to the river - making miles of desolate, but interesting scenery, the occasional little strip of cultivated land, showing emerald green in the desolation. We passed <placeName ref="#Gebel_el_Silsila">Gebel Silsileh</placeName>, and then <placeName ref="#Kawm_Umbū">Kom Ombos</placeName> like <pb n="46"/> the wind - and could only have a glimpse of them as we rushed by. We have reached the region of the "Sakkieh" or water wheel, which has almost superceded the pole and bucket of the Shadoof. The Sakkieh consists of two cogged wooden wheels, one set horizontally a few feet from the ground on the top of the river bank, which turns the second wheel placed vertically, with projecting beams, which support a chain of earthen jars - the main wheel is turned by oxen, and it is not only a labour saving machine, but a very picturesque one. It has its own music too, which is only a shade less melancholy than the song of the poor shadoof worker, because it is not the expression of a human voice. At a distance it sometimes reminds one of the bagpipe, and it possesses a unique gamut between creaking and groaning. We think we have made over <measure quantity="50" unit="mile">50 miles</measure> today!</p>

        <p>A quick and delightful sail this morning from our resting place of last night, about <measure quantity="12" unit="mile">12 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>, brought us to our landing place here at the <placeName ref="#Elephantine">Island of Elephantine</placeName>, by 11 o'clock. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> audibly and devoutly thanked God several times, as he confessed he had much fear of our "big front sail" and now, this "big front sail" of which we have been so proud, is to be furled away before we leave <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> for our downward journey - the towering boom alas! is to be lashed from end to end of the dahabeah, and the small aft sail and boom substituted - as with the downward current and the wind, the big <pb n="47"/> sail would make it dangerous. We drew up beside an English dahabeah, and immediately began preparations for a stay of several days. The men have been making ready for two or three days, washing their clothes, and getting themselves up in clean turbans, as most of them are <orgName ref="#Nubians">Nubians</orgName>, and live somewhere in the neighborhood of <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. Many of their friends have met them, and effusive greetings have been the order of the day. A cold and delicious wind was blowing and every breath was a pleasure. As you approach <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> it presents so many startling and interesting features, that I cannot attempt a description now. As soon as we were fast, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> went for a little stroll along the sandy bank, and I amused myself vastly looking about. The men were springing about getting up their awnings the fowls were carried out and deposited on the sand, <persName ref="#Benis">Benis</persName>' little cook stove too was picketed out - and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName>'s magnificent tent was pitched, carpets and a table and chairs carried out to it, causing the wildest excitement to the group of half clothed juveniles who had gathered about us, - basket dealers and antiquity vendors arrived, and such greetings as "how d'ye do, baksheesh," "goodbye baksheesh" or "antiche, antiche" resounded. Presently arrived two slim young men, one of them a negro in a fez, wearing very awkwardly the European costume, who proved to be the agent of the <orgName ref="#American Consulate">American Consular</orgName> Agent, who is himself, at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> - the other was his friend and interpreter, who had learned his really good English at the American School at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, and when I asked him if it was usually as cold here, as this morning, <pb n="48"/> said "Oh! No! this was one single cold morning and he had taken some cough from it." <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> got back in time to see these dignified officials, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> was in raptures at the "bazaar" which had accumulated itself on the shore.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> had a bad headache - and, leaving her under <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName>'s care, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I took the felucca for a row amongst the islands - the men singing and pulling. The rock scenery in the neighborhood of the cataract is something very wonderful. Huge strange masses of granite broken, and heaped together in wildest confusion - hardly a sharp edge or angle anywhere - all worn and rounded by attrition, and the motion of water through enormous ages. Where the river has come in contact with the rock, it has covered it with a deposit of iron - and the strange forms into which it is worn, scooped out into giant cauldrons, and mighty sockets, give them the look of iron castings. These ancient stones covered in many places with the hieroglyphs of thousands of years ago, give one a glimmering perception of the age of one old world. The islands were so lovely with their groups of <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name>, and graceful scent and <name type="plant" ref="#acacia">acacia</name> trees - and their terraced low shores, formed by the receding waters of the river, gave them all a certain artificial air. We stopped at the small island of <placeName ref="#Shellal">Shellal</placeName> - and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> climbed to a height, where a good view of the cataract was to be had. This, I was not up to, so I walked about as well as I could through the sand, and over the stones, guarded and followed and supported by two of our men. Part of the island was <pb n="49"/> carefully irrigated, and <name type="plant" ref="#huma">huma</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#mimosa">mimosa</name> and <name type="plant" ref="#acacia">acacias</name> were thriftily growing. The men got me some branches of a shrub I had noticed here and there along the shores, with delicate, rather stiff green branches thrusting themselves out in the slanting graceful fashion a <name type="plant" ref="#buck_tree">buck tree</name> has. The leaf was like a <name type="plant" ref="#mimosa">mimosa</name>, small and insignificant, with strong sharp white thorns, two or three times as long as the primate leaf, in the axis of which they grew. We met a little old <orgName ref="#Nubians">Nubian</orgName> woman, almost clean, stepping briskly along. She had nice eyes and a pleasant voice, and asked no baksheesh. She was much pleased when <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> addressed her in <orgName ref="#Nubians">Nubian</orgName>, and said he belonged to her country, looking shyly up at the tall, dignified figure, and the handsome costume. She and I exchanged smiles now and then in the place of words, and when her way parted from ours, she gave us such cheerful goodnight greetings, that I think the memory of her will always abide with me. Soon after we encountered a good natured savage, with a spear in his hand, and a few insignificant rags hanging about his bronze body - he careered about us in warlike fashion, shivering his spear and pitching it at incredible distances - he did not demand baksheesh, but he clearly wanted to sell his spear. A <measure type="currency">half piastre</measure> which I gave him, transformed him into a peaceful, humble admirer, who went with me to the boat, and presented me at parting a bunch of fragrant <name type="plant" ref="#lupine">lupine flowers</name>, smiling and nodding at me, as long as he could see me. All these little things make such pretty and pleasant pictures to hang in the gallery of ones memory! That evening hour - the sweet note of some unknown bird - the strange scenery - the <pb n="50"/> two almost barbarous people, human beings like myself, with whom for a moment, I had come in friendly contact! Such memories become mental possessions! Then we rowed across the river to <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>, and walked to the Post Office.</p>

        <p>We are lying at the island of <placeName ref="#Elephantine">Elephantine</placeName> (West side) opposite <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. <placeName ref="#Elephantine">Elephantine</placeName> is in <placeName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> on the border line of <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - the dahabeahs all moor at this island - and it forms almost the only verdantly green spot, in the barren desolation of the neighborhood of <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. It is crowded with <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name> and graceful <name type="plant" ref="#acacia">acacias</name>, and green with <name type="plant" ref="#castor_oil_bush">castor oil bushes</name>, crops of <name type="plant" ref="#wheat">wheat</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#lupin">lupins</name> and the fragrant <name type="plant" ref="#lentiles">lentiles</name> now in flower. Occasionally a splendid old <name type="plant" ref="#sycamore">sycamore</name>, the true Plantanum Occidentalis is growing - between us and the town stretches a wide beach of loose sand - and the large town beyond is entirely <orgName ref="#Nubian">Nubian</orgName> in its inhabitants and features. All day long, the women are coming and going with their water jars, poised so gracefully on the head, or driving their ugly buffalo cows down to water - and the children haunt the dahabeahs, on the lookout for baksheesh, or offering some trifle for sale. Opposite, on its high bank, lies <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> with its <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palm trees</name>, its curious little R.R. station, its shops, bazaars, <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s offices, government offices, etc. Along the principal street fronting the river, are some really good houses - the town is well built and moderately clean, and the English officers on their <pb n="51"/> horses, and Soudanese soldiers with their good uniforms and military bearing, give one a certain assurance of order and well being. The shore is lined with boats discharging and receiving cargoes, and one of the Egyptians police steam boats, or one of <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s postal or passenger steamers, is generally lying there. The sands are noisy with the donkey boys and their donkeys - with grumbling camels and shouting drivers, with vendors of straw mats and baskets, and strange barbarous looking weapons, altogether making as we went over this morning, a most animated and interesting scene. A large garrison of Egyptian soldiers, mostly Soudanese, is stationed here - the officers are English. It has suffered much from the loss of its Soudanese trade, since the abandonment of the <placeName ref="#Soudan">Soudan</placeName>. It occupies the site of the ancient <placeName ref="#Aswan">Syene</placeName>, and boasted of temples, and a Nilometer, magnificent quays, of which some ruins are to be seen, and, considering its ancient glory, the prophecies of <persName type="historical" ref="#Ezekiel">Ezekiel</persName> read most strangely. We walked along the pleasant highway shaded by <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name>, running along the bank of the river, until we reached the entrance to the bazaar, where is a little square with police station, dispensary, two or three sentinels, piles of cannon balls, and two cannons. The bazaar is in a way the most fascinating I have ever seen - with its pretty basket work, and the strange barbaric arms and weapons and ornaments - these are not so strange and interesting as the people - I feel as if I should never tire of going there, and seeing that motley crowd: Turks, <orgName ref="#Copts">Copts</orgName>, <pb n="52"/> Greeks, negroes - splendid looking <orgName ref="#Ababdehs">Ababdehs</orgName> with their fine bearing; and delicate aquiline features, and voluminous white turbans - jet black Soudanese, with their heavy features - the women in their white clothes, with their black, black faces, with barbaric silver bracelets and anklets, rings in their noses and ears, and ornaments on the forehead - and above all, the wild looking <orgName ref="#Bushareen">Bushareen</orgName>, with the hair in long thick curls - all made such a scene, that I could hardly give my attention to the fascinations of the bazaar. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought a really fine sword, and two assaigais, a Soudanese shield and other things - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I, some baskets and engraved gourds. We lunched early, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> rode over to <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName>, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> well mounted on a horse that belonged a few weeks ago, to an English officer, killed in a skirmish with the <orgName ref="#Dervishes">Dervishes</orgName>. After receiving a visit from <persName ref="#Harrison_Miss">Miss Harrison</persName> and <persName ref="#Clarke_Miss">Miss Clarke</persName> from the English dahabeah, <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> went for a tour of the island in the felucca. One of the most fascinating features of dahabeah life is this little felucca - each one carries the national flag of the owner for the time of the dahabeah - and the sailors vie with each other in their songs. Our crack singer wins not only admiring attention, but bursts of applause and encores. These songs of the sailors interest me. At first, each one seemed like the other - all wild chants in minor keys - then one emerged in identity - then another - now, we all have our favorites - and the men are much pleased when we ask for them - "<persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Aunt Emma</persName>'s song" <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> calls one of them - because I one evening, wondering what the sentiment of <pb n="53"/> the song was, asked <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> the meaning of the words - he replied with impressive and gently dignity, with his hand on his heart, "Madame, it is the song of the heart - the lie - and the world"! A very suggestive title! At another time when I asked him the meaning of a song, he said, "do not ask me Madame, it is not a good song". One especially pretty song, has a more marked cadence than any I have heard, and they sing it only when rowing - certain words coming in like a refrain all through it sound like, "Gwady mesh". <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> told me this meant, "the flowery, shining way of the river"! No one knows how old this song may be, for this river to the Egyptians and <orgName ref="#Nubians">Nubians</orgName> has been for thousands and thousands of years "the shining way". On our return we found the cards of some English officers on our tea table, and an American dahabeah had arrived. We now make four here - as the <name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">"Flying Dutchman"</name> came up this morning. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> tells me she has worked up the river in a very hard fashion, sailing night and day.</p>

        <p>As we have been waiting for two days to go to <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName>, <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> not being well enough, and hearing that the people from the two <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName> steamers that came in yesterday, are going over tomorrow, we thought we might have it quite to ourselves today, and therefore last night ordered lunch to be prepared early this morning, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>'s horse and our donkeys sent over to ride back, for we took the train over, <pb n="54"/> fearing the ride both ways would be too much for me. We breakfasted early and went across to the R.R. station. This little railway running across the desert to a point above the 1st cataract, was built by the English, and is now owned by the Egyptian government, and was used through the war for transportation of stores and troops. Such a comical little affair - the engines painted white, the single passenger car a broad long box, with divans on each side running the length of it, covered with flowered calico! It brought us in half an hour to the station opposite <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName>, and we were taken across in a native boat to the lovely island. Familiar as I was with its general features from prints and photographs, it looked as strange in its wild chaotic setting of fantastic rocks. No words can give any idea of the remarkable rock scenery of the first cataract. We climbed the steep bank, and took our way over the debris of ruins to the lovely little temple known as "Pharaoh's Bed" with its group of overhanging <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name>. Here we sat down in the bright sunlight, and tried to think we were quite comfortable, for the morning was cold, on the terrace in front of the temple, looking sheer down to the river. We soon had some hot coffee served, thanks to the thoughtfulness of <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> lighted a cigar, <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> went off some distance to sketch this little temple, and I opened my books to read about its history. Across the river at the edge of a town was a burying ground and little mosque - and a strange sound of wailing attracted my attention. I saw a great collection of people, and with the glass discovered that a funeral was taking place - and these dole- <pb n="55"/> ful sounds came from the women mourners, who in a body apart from the rest, were going through the customary perfunctory mourning, throwing the head violently backwards and forwards, their long hair streaming in the wind - a custom old as the hills about us. Then we were visited by a <persName ref="#Newman_Mr">Mr.</persName> and <persName ref="#Newman_Mrs">Mrs. Newman</persName> - he, a Florentine Artist, American by birth, she, an Englishwoman. They are living in their dahabeah, lying just below us - having received permission from government to take their dahabeah above the first cataract (which has not been allowed since the war) as he is making some colored drawings of the temple. We walked about with them for awhile, and found them very agreeable, and not offensively instructive - she with that air I always envy in English women - of serene satisfaction in her own being, opinions and conditions. We went with them through the first great court, with its splendid colonnade on either side - but of unequal length, and set at irregular angles - the center of it heaped with the mud brick ruins of some <orgName ref="#Copts">Coptic</orgName> houses, now destroyed, which also had invaded the lovely little temple at the corner of the largest colonnade, just hanging over the river in its ruins. Even the space between the seven <persName ref="#Hathor">Hathor</persName> columns had been built up with mud bricks. At the further end of this court is the well known great portal, flanked by its mighty pylons, with their huge sculpturings - beyond this, an inner court with colonnades on either side, with rooms and chapel opening off from one of them. Here, the capitals of the columns were beautiful - then followed the second pylons, and pillared portico, with its profuse sculptures <pb n="56"/> and hieroglyphs - every where it has been brilliantly painted - and the well known capitals are still brilliant with color - such lovely greenish blue, the predominating color - pure as the sky - such delicate red pinks and tender greens - it must be the despair of any artist to attempt in fresh color, to represent these tints worn by time to such soft brilliancy. This painted portico was quite filled with the workmen and their ladders, of some Frenchman engaged in the atrocious process known as "squeezing" - which consists of a moist preparation of paper applied to the surface - a process which takes away all colour from the sculpture - and everywhere we have been in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>, traces of this nefarious process can be seen. Into the dark gloomy rooms beyond this portico we went, and tried to make out some of the sculptures, then up the staircase to the roof of one of the pylons to see the curious little temple of <persName ref="#Osiris">Osiris</persName> - a kind of Holy of holies - representing the death process of mummification, and bringing to life of <persName ref="#Osiris">Osiris</persName>. By this time, the wind had increased to such violence, that nothing could be seen because of the clouds of blinding dust - and we were glad to take shelter in the so called "Queens Chamber", opening out of the inner court, where in the gloom and dust, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and "<persName ref="#Jacoub">Jagoub</persName>" were busy setting out our lunch - and what a good one it was! The wind increasing, we sent a card to <persName ref="#Newman_Mrs">Mrs. Newman</persName>, excusing ourselves from tea, and were taken across the river again, and after some noisy talking and vociferating, were riding home across the desert - the wind almost tearing our clothes off of us - and sending cataracts of sand into our <pb n="57"/> eyes and ears - We were happy to reach the comfort and seclusion of our little home - and the steaming samovar, and refreshing tea. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> went across to the P.O. for us, and brought back an armful of papers and letters.</p>

        <p>We took things rather quietly this morning, and not until after eleven o'clock did we get into the felucca for a row around the island of <placeName ref="#Elephantine">Elephantine</placeName> - and to the strange music of the sailors' songs, we glide past the shining hieroglyphed rocks, the little beaches with their different levels, looking like shallow flights of steps - the green shores - the groups of waving palms, and pull up at the foot of the steep cliffs on the western side of the river. These cliffs are thickly and softly carpeted with yellow sand - and up this we begin climbing, to visit the tombs opened by <persName ref="#Grenfell_General">General Grenfell</persName> two or three years - but this was very hard work - and two of the men making a kind of chair with their arms and hands, carried me to the platform, <measure type="distance" quantity="100" unit="foot">100 feet</measure> high upon which these tombs open. They belong to the 6th and 12th dynasties - the most perfect one is that of an officer of <persName ref="#King_Pepi">King Pepi 2d</persName>. The paintings are something startling and wonderful in their freshness - with a brilliant white metallic background, and the colors as fast as though laid on yesterday. So new and fresh did they look that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> scouted politely at my assertion that they had not <pb n="58"/> been "restored". Coming away we saw what I might call a hillside of human skulls and bones, and fluttering shreds of mummy cloth - and the Custodian of the tombs had a sweetly pretty collection of grinning skulls, and stray femurs and tibias etc. mingled with a few insignificant ornaments and rude broken pottery. Am so sorry I did not buy one of these ancient skulls for <persName ref="#Rogers_Will">Will Rogers</persName>! It never occurred to me like most of my happy thoughts until too late. After luncheon again in the felucca and across the river, and while <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> walked, I went into the bazaar with <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and some of our men. We then mounted horse and donkeys and went out to some ancient granite quarries, passing through an Arab cemetery, than which, amidst such a scene of desolation as that, nothing more dismal can be imagined. In this quarry there lies a giant obelisk in the rough - with no inscription to tell for whom it was intended, and ages ago, deserted and left unfinished. The manner of cutting these stones is very plainly to be seen, in the rocks about here - lines of wedge holes, into which wooden wedges were driven, and then soaked with water, caused the rock to split, along the line desired. We rode home through the town, by devious ways through narrow streets, and under arches - giving most picturesque effects, and our clattering cavalcade brought all the inhabitants to the front - then we came out upon the river bank, and found our felucca waiting - and were rowed home across a river, reflecting in most tender manner the delicious sunset colouring of sky and mountain.</p>

        <p><pb n="59"/> We have had a whole delicious day at <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName>! Scorning to take the R.R. train again I protested that I would ride both ways. An early breakfast, and a great stir of preparation among <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and the men, the saddles and the lunch baskets, the portable table and the camp chairs, and the rugs, all of which <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> thinks essential to our comfort, had been sent over before us - and then the men pulled us over and there were our animals saddled and bridled - one sumpter mule or donkey almost hidden under his load. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> rode - but 3 of our men who went with us, walked or ran all that distance. The morning was lovely, and I felt at peace (with one or two exceptions!) with all the world as we took our way across the railway, then through some narrow streets, and up the barren hill side - through the cemetery, and out upon the desert. The road, or rather wide track through the sand, is really an ancient highway, between the cataract and <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> - as the inscriptions upon many of the rocks on either side testify - some of these consist merely of names - others are a kind of votive tablet, inscribing thanks and praises to the gods of the cataract - kings, priest and generals have left here on these rocks records of their journey from the <name type="boat" ref="#Soudan">Soudan</name>. The rocks are most fantastic - piled up on their enormous rounded surfaces - in many places showing the sky between their interstices, and looking as if a breath of wind might topple them over - and everywhere the yellow, yellow sand from the <placeName ref="#Lybia">Lybian</placeName> desert - in some places in such great drifts between the hills, <pb n="60"/> that they looked like glazier beds of solid gold. Where the rocks had been broken, the syenite or porphyry showed most lovely tints. I could not but exclaim again and again at the beauty of the rose and pink tints - and the rock showed here and there under our feet, through the yellow sand, like a rosy substructure. The ride of <measure quantity="6" unit="mile">6 miles</measure> seems very soon to come to an end, although in the defiles of the hills the sun burned out of the deep blue cloudless sky down upon that yellow sand, in a way that made us wonder how human beings could make that transit in summer. We found a native boat waiting for us, and we were rowed some distance, then got out and climbed a hill to see the cataract - and some half dozen, naked shivering men swim down it. The best exploit was that of a <orgName ref="#Nubian">Nubian</orgName> who went down on a leg through the midst of it, waving a red flag, without once losing his seat. I thought he well deserved the <measure type="currency">two piastres</measure> he got for this performance. In the distance we could see a dahabeah belonging to the English general commanding the frontier, making the ascent, and the swarms of natives on the rocks. Then we were rowed back to <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName> and were happy to see a large party of <orgName ref="#Gage_Company">Gage</orgName>'s tourists just leaving it. Our little "Dragoman" was waiting at the top of the bank, and was my bewitching and devoted slave all day, waving his little fly brush about me, and screaming "imshee" "imshee" to every other child who approached me. I hardly know what it was in that child that was so touching and attractive, that little brown figure so pretentious in its affectation of help, the patient little sober face, rarely lighting into a sunny smile <pb n="61"/> - the waiting watchful little eyes, absorbed in me and my comfort went straight to my heart - and I cannot think of him without a little stab of pain in my heart - and when we said goodbye to him as we came along in the afternoon, he followed us to the boat crying "goodbye- goodbye".</p>
        <p>We lunched in Pharaoh's Bed", which I grieve to say was large enough to accommodate three other dahabeah parties - and then while <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> was sketching, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I wandered about the whole of the island, and sat down in the little temple of <persName ref="#Nectanebo">Nectanebo</persName>, with its <persName ref="#Hathor">Hathor</persName> headed columns, at the corner of the west colonnade of the large court - and looked down upon the river and off to the mountains over which that beautiful warm pinkish tinge which we have so often noticed on the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName>, was already gathering. We might have thought of the old <persName ref="#Ptolemy_XI">Ptolemies</persName>, of <persName ref="#Cleopatra">Cleopatra</persName>, of the changing fortunes and history of this lovely island, but, as <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Mariette</persName> says, "the impression of the moment must prevail over the memories evoked", and we drank in the beauty without saying much of its history - while trying to photograph the scene upon my mind, the thought arose again and again "Will I ever see this again"! I made afterwards a very faithful tour of the island climbing over big rocks, and stumbling over small ones. There is a certain satisfaction in finding that the foolish craze for scribbling an unknown name on an undying monument, does not belong only to we moderns, for the walls, and pylons and columns of this temple show that for ages this has been done by those visiting the island. But all the same, "<persName ref="#Seranton_James_B">James B. Seranton</persName>" cut deeply into the stone followed <pb n="62"/> by the names of an American town and state, looks more intrusive and intolerable than one done in Greek or Latin. We rowed partly around the island before we said a final adieu, and the effect was most lovely, looking up to the stately temples - the groups of graceful <name type="plant" ref="#palm_trees">palms</name> and <name type="plant" ref="#mimosa">mimosas</name> hiding much of the debris at their base. The ride home through the desert, was even more lovely than in the morning - the soft sunset lights were so beautiful in all that desolation. We heard the sweet warbling of the crested lark about us - and dozens of the pretty things were flying about the rocks - and numbers of strange little birds with brown and gray plumage and red bills were so tame they would hardly move out of the path before us. Home across the river at last, tired and sleepy - a warm welcome from all the men, <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais Achmed</persName> waiting to receive us - and <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName>'s dinner table ready and inviting.</p>

        <p>This afternoon the felucca took us across to <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>, to visit the <orgName ref="#Gov_Dispensary">Government Dispensary</orgName>, as we wanted glue, sticking plaster, and quinine pills - only this last could be had. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">T.</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> then walked, while <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and some of the men went with me in to the bazaar, where I never tire of going, and looking at that strange crowd. The <orgName ref="#Busharin_Bedouins">Busharin Bedouins</orgName> are the most barbarous looking men you see - and such splendid looking fellows from <placeName ref="#Khartoum">Khartoum</placeName>, with their fine bearing - and their regular features - and their bronze skins. They look as if they <pb n="63"/> might all be <persName>Ben Hurs</persName> - and <persName>Abdallahs!</persName> I came away with some very pretty Nubian baskets - and was rowed down to the trysting place. I saw <persName ref="#Hughes_Frederick_Sir">Sir Frederick</persName> and <persName ref="#Hughes_Lady">Lady Hughes</persName> entering the <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook</orgName>'s steamer "<name type ="boat" ref ="#Amamis">Amasis</name>" so I was carried ashore, and walked down to it meeting <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> on the way, and we all went on board to look them up - found them and asked them to dinner, promising to send the felucca for them. They accepted with delight evidently - as <persName ref="#Hughes_Lady">Lady Hughes</persName> was very anxious to know something of life of a dahabeah. Then we hurried home through the rose tinted water, to give the cook a warming. Such dismay as it created, for he declared he had nothing! absolutely nothing, with his hand upon his heart in a tragic manner. Then I attempted to subdue some of the eastern abundance of the table, and plunged <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName> in deep despair by telling him to carry three of the four dishes of nuts he always will put on the table away - and making a selection from the numerous sweetmeats, and keeping only one dish of oranges. Even <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> thought I carried the matter too far, in my attempt at elegant simplicity. We had a delicious dinner, among other things a very knowing sweetbread vol-au-vent - and <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Hanna Ibrahim</persName> makes the most perfect pastry I have ever seen. This evidently commended itself warmly to <persName ref="#Hughes_Frederick_Sir">Sir Frederick</persName> - and he was loud in his praises of our cook. We went up to the deck with <persName ref="#Hughes_Frederic_Sir">Sir. F.</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> when they went to smoke. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> had arranged it most charmingly with lanterns, and the crew down on their deck played and sang their choicest songs. We sent them home delighted with their visit and could hear the songs of the men as they went in the stillness of the night across to the steamer.</p>
        <p><pb n="64"/> Every day adds to the charm of <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> - and we loudly and constantly bemoan the fact that we have so little time. We have discussed again and again the voyage to the 2d cataract but <orgName ref="#Thomas_Cook">Cook's</orgName> little postal steamers are filled with his own tourists, and there is no way to do it, but by chartering one of them, leaving the "<name type="boat" ref="Nubia">Nubia</name>" here to wait for us. It would be very expensive, and take about 3 more weeks, so we have reluctantly abandoned the scheme. We don"t yet allow <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> to mention the leaving of <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>, but I can see that the necessity of an early decision is growing more and more apparent. All of our men being Nubians they have been allowed to go to their homes for a visit, most of them taking a day or two or three - and every day now, <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais Achmed</persName> suggests through <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> the propriety of settling upon a day of departure.</p>

        <p>On our getting out of our felucca this morning at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> we were met by the youthful and comical agent of the <name>Consular Agent</name> at <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor</name>, who in his boyish timid manner begged <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> to ask us to come to the <placeName>Consulate</placeName> and have coffee with him. We had seem him hovering on our skirts on several occasions, and knew this thing was imminent, so we assented with the best possible grace we could assume, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> kindly turned him over to me to entertain, so I walked along with him and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> keeping up a certain amount of talk - while <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> walked behind indulging in the most amusing criticisms of me and my <pb n="65"/>: official, but the little black fellow, looking so uncomfortable and gene in his European dress, seemed to find so much satisfaction in the situation, that all my impatience vanished. We went into a very good apartment, with flowered chintz divans, and tawdry Turkish decorations, and ornamented with several American flags - and had some poor coffee, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> said the cigarettes were worse - then got away, after a fraternal hand shake all around.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon the wind being cold and strong I stayed at home - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> going in the felucca to some of the islands. I had a most deliciously quiet afternoon with my book on deck, protected from the wind by the close awnings, only opened just enough towards the west , to give me a view of the color deepening on earth and in the sky. Every night there comes a strange and very beautiful effect. The sun sets in a perfectly cloudless yellow sky - after he has gone down, a tender pink begins to blush deeply over the sky, turning to an amethyst blue at the horizon - the water reflects it, and the distant mountains are softly purple - and tonight the little silver thread of the crescent moon added to the lovely beauty of the evening. Just after <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> got home, and we were taking tea about our smoking samovar, we had a pleasant visit from two English officers, who invited us to afternoon tea tomorrow, to see the Soudanese soldiers perform their national or tribal dances, which they always do on Friday, that being their Sunday.</p>

        </dateline>
        <p><pb n="66"/> A serious consultation was held this morning, as the question of the day of our departure could no longer be deferred. After sighs and groans and useless protestations, we finally decided that we must be off tomorrow. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> at once said she should devote the morning to the painting of <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mahomet Ali</persName>, our 2d steersman, so leaving her surrounded by her paints in the cabin with poor <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mahomet</persName> stiffening out of all his usual grace, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I with four of the men went out in the felucca for a last tour among the islands. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> steering - to the great amusement of the men, who kept a furtive watch of him all the time - and when they had warned him to keep out from shore, and he had persisted in going his own way, and brought us scraping across a rock, after the first flurry of excitement, their delight was great - again and again they would be seized with fits of laughter, and not doubt they made a pretty story of it among themselves. How lovely it all was! As we came around the northern end of <placeName ref="#Elephantine">Elephantine</placeName>, past the pretty little hospital with its green jalousies and awnings, we were passed by a large dahabeah carrying the English flag, and away down the river could be seen the white wings of another. Already, we number 10 at the mooring ground - and lie too close for comfort and health. We landed at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> and walked about, going once more and for the last time through the bazaar. At four o'clock in the afternoon the felucca took us across below the town, to the camp, and there at the landing we found <persName ref="#Judge_Captain">Captain Judge</persName>, <pb n="67"/> and an Italian officer, <persName ref="#Fabarella_Count">Count Fabarella</persName>. We were first taken to the quarters of <persName ref="#Judge_Captain">Capt. Judge</persName>, and had tea and some excellent hot toast, and saw some very interesting <orgName ref="#Dervish">Dervish</orgName> things - weapons, drums, saddles and their very extraordinary dress - looking as if it had been made out of a cotton crazy bed-quilt - the cap and the long gown being made of coloured cottons, very thickly wadded and quilted - it is said to form an excellent coat of mail. Then we walked about the quarters which were very neat - the mud houses of the officers painted white with protecting roofs - and neat little gardens, shaded by palm trees. The most interesting thing was the village where the wives and families of the soldiers live - the only clean mud town I have seen in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Some of the women were sitting at the doors of their little huts sewing. The children looked clean and had good eyes - and the women were good looking, quiet and respectful - their densely black skins, with their white dress and silver ornaments being very effective. There is a head woman or matron, <persName ref="#Judge_Captain">Capt. Judge</persName> told us, who exercises a kind of discipline over the women - as to their cleanliness, order etc. and the pay of the men is so good, that many of them keep a servant. He also told us that there are now no English soldiers above <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> - though all the principal officers are English. The <orgName ref="#Egyptian_army">Egyptian Army</orgName> numbers about 13,000. All of the officers speak most highly of these Soudanese soldiers - even affectionately - they are tall, well made men - black as a polished stove pipe - quiet under discipline - of great endurance, and can outmarch any English or European soldier. They <pb n="68"/> receive 20 cents a day, clothes and rations - and are so much better off than in their native state, that the <orgName ref="#Egyptian_army">army</orgName> can never want soldiers. They enlist during the pleasure of the <orgName ref="#Government">Government</orgName>, which really means for life, or as long as they remain able bodied. The utmost decency - cleanliness and order are exacted from them - and the <orgName ref="Egyptian_army">army</orgName> in this way, must act, through the influence of the English officers commanding it, as a potent engine for civilization and good.</p>
        <p>By the time we had inspected the quarters, the dancers were in full swing - and we walked about looking at them. Every tribe danced by themselves - and two or three drummers formed the centre of each ring of dancers. Their drums were native, a rude kind of barrel, with a skin stretched on top, and drummed with the hand, in a particularly telling and exciting way. The dance began with a slow shuffling awkward circling about the drummers - each man held some stick or weapon, and as they warmed to the work, each seemed to do what he pleased in the way of drumming and shouting. I can imagine that in the native dress, or rather ornaments, it might be weird and horrible, but it seemed a trifle civilized and perfunctory - though we were told they keep it up for hours every Friday, with great enjoyment, and long after I was in bed, the distant sound of their drumming came to my ears. The officers walked down to our boat with us and siad goodbye, we came home in the twilight, the oars dipping into the calm pink water, and keeping time to the wild, low chanting of the men - the young moon trembling in the soft sky, and throwing a silver trail across the river, <pb n="69"/> in the distance the mountains glowing in deep warm purple - all the peculiar charming effect of an Egyptian evening, after the sun has just gone down. As we drew up to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>, we groaned and sighed that this should be our last evening at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>.</p>

        <p>At half past eight o'clock this morning as I was hurrying with my dressing, I heard the anchor pulled up, a babel of voices outside and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> calling us to hurry out and witness our departure. Two more dahabeahs arrived last evening, and as I went on deck, I felt the first shiver of movement, and one of these dahabeahs pulled up behind us to take our place as we moved away. Days ago, our big boom and sail in which we have taken such pride, was taken down and lashed along the length of the the dahabeah, and the small after sail put in its place. The planks were taken up in sections on the lower deck, so giving the 5 sailors on each side a place to sit and row - there they were, the oars in their hands, the ropes were hauled, and we pulled out into the current, and began our slow progress down the river. How sorry we felt to leave it all behind! and it seemed as if the day before us would be interminable. One after another of the pleasant land marks were left behind, and then a bend of the river shut it all away from our lingering eyes. There has been a light head wind all day - and against this our men rowed from the time of starting, until 12 o'clock, when they rested two hours - then took to <pb n="70"/> the oars again until half past six, bringing us about <measure type ="distance" quantity="12" unit="mile">12 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. Our sympathies have been excited for them, for the effort seems a great one. They stand on the narrow section of the deck, between the open divisions, giving in unison a strong pull backwards, then step down to a level below the section, giving another strong pull which brings them back upon their seats - the oars are suddenly raised, and the whole process begins again. During most of the time they sang. During all the time we have been on the river, we have had a south wind only for half or three quarters of an hour - and the prospect of rowing back to <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, seems a gloomy one today! The downward progress of a dahabeah on the river is a most absurd and humiliating one. Unless when rowed, or the unusual south wind fills the sail, the boat drifts, apparently helpless - and we have been amused and exasperated today to see the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> almost putting her nose into the mud bank on one side, then backing with her stern into the opposite shore, or going stern first down the river, or standing foolishly across it! and the points of the compass become hopelessly confused in your mind, and I am beginning to have some anxieties about <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>, fear the inaction and slow progress may prove hard to bear. He ought to have another man with him. Going on deck after dinner we found every man almost of the crew already wrapped in their rugs, and asleep on the deck - I am sure we none of us slept as soundly as they did that night.</p>

        <p><pb n="71"/>	Much to our surprise and satisfaction this morning, we found a strong south east wind blowing, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> came down from the deck to breakfast, saying we were sailing splendidly, and making <measure type="speed" quantity="6" unit="miles/hour">six</measure> and <measure type="speed" quantity="7" unit="miles/hour">seven miles an hour</measure>, and that <placeName ref="#Kawm_Umbū">Kom Omboa</placeName> was in sight. We had intended stopping here on our way down, but really, except for real investigation, all that is left of the temple can be seen from the river. Built after the conquest of <persName type="historical" ref="#Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</persName>, the encroachments of the river are now fast destroying it - its fa&#231;ade has fallen, and huge stones lie half in and half out of the water. So it was decided not to interrupt our glorious course at that time, so flying past it we kept on our way. The wind increased in force, and by afternoon it was almost a gale, and the numerous rocks in the river made the sailing exciting. I was in my room, half asleep when I heard a great uproar on deck, the wildest shouting and jumping about. I hurried out of the cabin, but found the lower deck in such confusion I did not venture farther than the little gangway, but I saw that we were being driven by the wind on to the rocks and that the efforts of our excited <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> - steersmen and crew could not protect her from rather an alarming bump. Our first steersman however who is a dignified magnificent giant had left his rudder, cleared the lower deck with one bound, gone overboard, and took part of the shock from the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>, by offering his Herculean shoulder as a <hi rend="underline">bumper</hi>. The whole action was really a splendid thing. At first, we did not know whether we were hurt or not - but examination revealed <pb n="72"/>no injury - and we thankfully pulled off the rocks and around a corner near two cangias or working boats, which had also blown ashore - and here we waited for the wind to lull. We got ashore and climbed the bank to see what we could see - and found ourselves in a wretched little encampment of <placeName>Busharin</placeName> - a man came to meet us with his long bushy curls stuck through with a wooden needle, and some green leaves - and the veriest yellow white rags I have ever seen gathered about his bronze body - his face was utterly out of keeping with all his surrounding, for it was a noble one, the features delicately cut, and the teeth perfect in form and pearly whiteness - his whole bearing was so noble and dignified that it was a little shock to see him put out his hand at once and demand backsheesh. There were two low tents covered with two or three miserable rugs and skins, not more than <measure type="distance" quantity="4" unit ="foot">4 feet</measure> from the ground. In front of the one before which we stopped, a young and rather pretty half clothed woman was squatting on the ground, with a pot sitting upon a little fire of sticks, into which, she was stirring water and flour. I think the only household utensils they had were that pot, the wooden spoon with which she stirred the soup, and a small gourd - a mangy dog hovered about - and as wretched a looking camel as I ever saw crouched near. She had a nice face, the same white glittering teeth, and a small irregular piece of silver coming out of one nostril, and flattened to the side of her nose - a safe way I suppose of carrying a valuable possession. A boy of about 5 years perfectly naked was standing by her and under the tent, lying in the dust which was here about a foot deep, <pb n="73"/>was a squalling brown baby of 2 years, who was presently scooped out of the dust, and crawling to his mother, squatted his little naked body by her side, tucked his head under her arm and fell to sucking as if he were a calf, and she a cow. Other men and naked children came up and join the party, and I thought what a scene it was - and what stages of civilization it showed. We, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and some of our men with him, and this group of half starved savages! I gave the woman a <measure type="currency">silver half piastre</measure> - at which she laughed and seemed much surprised - turning it over and over with curiosity - and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> gave the man <measure type="currency">2 piastres</measure>, which must have seemed a fortune to them. <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName> was sent to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> for <placeName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</placeName>'s camera. When the woman saw it, her face changed, and a look of fear came over it, and she began to mutter to herself as the camera was pointed to them. As we were walking on - the man pointing to a tent a short distance off, said to <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> that we must not go there, as there was a man ill with small pox - so we gladly ended our expedition and came back to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>. About 6, we got under way, and floated for three hours down near <placeName ref="#Gebel_el_Silsila">Silsileh</placeName>, where we have anchored.</p>

        <p>We dropped down early this morning to <placeName ref="#Gebel_el_Silsila">Gebel - Silsileh</placeName>, where are the famous sandstone quarries of the ancient days. While sitting at breakfast, we were being made fast to the bank on the west side, consisting of a little strip of earth and sand, and the sand stone cliffs rising irregularly beyond. The river narrows very much here, and the <pb n="74"/>mountains come down on either side close to the water. There was a special worship of the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> at <placeName ref="#Gebel_el_Silsila">Silsileh</placeName>, and the rocks are covered with inscriptions - consisting of hymns addressed to the river - some of them <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Mariette</persName> says in "lefty strains". The custom too of the ancient Egyptians of having a stela, or speos, or inscription commemorating of a visit to any consecrated spot, is shown here as on the road from <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName>. Many of the numerous grottoes here were tombs. Among the commemorative grottoes, the richest and most highly decorated were those of <persName ref="#Rameses_II">Rameses 2d</persName>, <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName> and <persName type="historical" ref="#Memptah_I">Memptah Ist</persName> - the fa&#231;ades supported by lotus columns - and must have been very beautiful in their prime - but the rich sculptures are mutilated and the paintings faded. Most of them consist of little corridors in the rock, with 3 or 4 openings - all have seats at the ends and the now mutilated figures sitting on them, as <persName ref="#Edwards_Amelia">Miss Edwards</persName> says "like owners in their opera boxes" give a very strange effect. What a strange scene it must have been here at that time, the rocks on the western shore gay with paintings, and the silent stone figures sitting in their boxes watching it all. The climbing here was something fearful - and I did not suppose I would be able to see much of the grottoes and quarries, but <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mahomet Ali</persName> and <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName> and sometimes <persName ref="#René">Ren&#233;</persName> carried me up and down and about that day, with the most smiling alacrity, wading through the sand and up and down the rocks the wind almost blowing my coat off me. The quarries on the eastern side are much more important and interesting - we crossed over in spite of the violent wind, and found them really <pb n="75"/> wonderful - great detached cubes and masses - their sharply cut edges rising straight up <measure type="distance">50</measure> and <measure type="distance">60 ft</measure>. - avenues cut in the rock as clean as it had been done yesterday - everywhere the wedge shaped markings like those at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>. It makes one giddy to try and think of the toiling millions that must have labored here - their lives, and their time of no significance to the haughty kings, who commanded and it was done. All is open to the blue sky - <persName ref="#Edwards_Amelia">Miss Edwards</persName> gives an excellent description of these quarries. When we crossed back to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>, the wind was so violent, we shipped water, and had to make a long distance. In the afternoon we went to the important "grotto of <persName ref="#Horus">Horus</persName>" the last king of the 18th dynasty. It is a long corridor out in the rock, and supported by four pillars - its rich sculptures and painting are mutilated and worn, until they are almost undecipherable - irregular holes <measure type ="distance">4</measure> and <measure type="distance">5 inches</measure> deep drilled into them, show how careful the destruction has been. The beautiful bas relief so well known of a goddess suckling the infant <persName ref="#Horus">Horus</persName> is here. <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Mariette</persName> pronounces it the best specimen of Egyptian art - and in spite of the ruin of it, it shows a sweetness and sentiment I have seen nowhere else. At the other end of the grotto is the almost equally well known "Triumph of <persName ref="#Horus">Horus</persName>". While <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> went off with <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> for what they called a walk, I and <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> strolled up and down the little beach where we had landed in the felucca, and picked some leaves of all the different things we could find, - almost all of which <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> pronounced "poison" when he saw them - though I knew better.</p>

        <p><pb n="76"/> A favoring wind this morning, and the stout arms of our sailors brought us so far on our way today, that when after luncheon we went on deck, we were amazed to see the lofty pylons of <persName ref="#Idfu">Edfoo</persName>, towering in the distance. The day was enchanting - the water without a ripple - and reflecting the golden tint of the mountains on the eastern shore. Before 3 o'clock we had pulled up to the bank, where a flock of donkeys and donkey boys had sprung up by some sort of magic, and after the usual wrangling and shrieking whilst the choosing and saddling of the donkeys was going on, we were en route for <placeName ref="#Idfu">Edfoo</placeName>. Clattering through the narrow streets between the mud houses, past the little <orgName ref="#American_Mission">American Mission</orgName> school, and the Arabian school, where all the little Arabs were squatting on the ground swaying and shrieking their <title ref="#Quran">Koran</title>, which is the only thing taught them, we went at last through a narrow lane, and dismounted at the top of a long flight of rude stone steps down to the level of the entrance to the temple. This important temple was entirely excavated (through the liberality of <persName ref="#Pasha_Isma'il">Ismail</persName>, father of the present Khedive) by <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Mariette</persName> in 1864, it was before that time smothered in the natural accumulation of the soil, and covered and surrounded by the mud houses of the village. Even the courts and chambers were filled almost to the top with debris - now all is entirely cleared - and the great temple lies entire and almost perfect - even to its enclosing wall, between which and the immense mounds of rubbish cleared from it, and which rise outside <pb n="77"/>almost to the top of it in places, there is a kind of moat. Where this rubbish is cut through, it shows complete strata of broken potsherds. I shall certainly not attempt a description of this temple - it can be found in a dozen books. When we arrived at the iron gate which stretches across the portal, it was found that <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> had forgotten the tickets, and while one of the men was despatched for them, we stood and gazed up at its great pylons, with their huge strange sculptured figures, which seemed to tower above us into the deep blue sky - when finally, the tickets arrived, the obdurate old custodian allowed us to enter the great hypostyle hall, where near the entrance there was a little table and chair, and O! shades of the Pharaohs! a visitors book, in which we were asked to put our names! This hall has an almost perfect colonnade on its four sides, then opens into the smaller court with its great columns, and then through the transept court, you gain the sanctuary beyond, where the monolithic granite shrine from some former temple, so often described, is standing in one corner. There are a series of rooms opening out from the smaller court, and running around the sanctuary - but the most wonderful feature of the temple is the lofty encircling wall, its entire surface covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions and sculptures. It is of Ptolemaic origin, and some idea of its dimensions may be gains by the statement of the fact that the pylons are only <measure type="distance">32 ft.</measure> lower than the top of the <placeName ref="#Place_Vendome">Vendame</placeName> column. We climbed the staircases, their walls crowded with figures, to the roof, where an enchanting view was opened to us. I shall not soon forget <pb n="78"/>one beautiful effect as we stood in the great court, near the smaller hypaethral one, through the opening of, which the intensely blue sky, against which an eagle was slowly flying, showed in contrast to the soft yellow cream of the sandstone! The scamper back to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> would have been charming had it not been for the chattering donkey boys and men, and the universal demand for backsheesh from every native we saw. When we reached the dahabeah, we found the usual market being held on the bank - women with baskets of eggs - pigeons and chickens. The simplest purchase from the natives becomes apparently an exciting and dangerous affair - they scream - they gesticulate - they call frantically upon Allah, but once the purchase is made, they relapse into quietness. No wonder they try to get all they can from these rich <orgName ref="#Howadji">Howadji</orgName> - what must we seem to them with all our belongings! One handsome rascal with glittering eyes and whitest teeth had a veritable "antika" to sell, which <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> at last bought - and archaic figure in alabaster - one of a triad evidently, as the feet of another one remains. The night is exquisitely beautiful - we have dropped down <measure type ="distance" quantity="6" unit="mile">6 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Idfu">Edfoo</placeName>, to a safer anchorage. We were walking the deck for some time - the moon shining safely bright - Orion stretched out above us - the Dipper standing on one end, having lost the last star of the handle - the water rippling against our bow, each ripple touched into silver - the only discordant sound the laboured rowing of the sailors. <pb n="79"/></p>

        <p>We make such early starts now, in order to get as far as possible before the north wind gets up that sleeping after 5 o'clock is a difficult thing. Today we have had very little head wind, and since 12 o'clock the river has been like a soft blue mirror, reflecting the warm yellow of the sandstone cliffs of the east side, and on either shore every object has been reproduced, inverted. The men sang and pulled lustily, and we made very good progress, until 3, when a wind from the north spoils everything - and with <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName> in sight the whole afternoon we have only succeeded in coming to a stop for the night just below the <orgName ref="#Russian_Consulate">Russian Consulate</orgName>, at 7 o'clock.

        <p>Light winds and the sturdy arms of our crew today, brought us from <placeName ref="#Esneh">Esneh</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, <measure type="distance" quantity="36" unit="mile">36 miles</measure>. Passing <placeName ref="#Armant">Erment</placeName> in the afternoon, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> wanted to stop and go ashore to a garden he knows well for fruit. Of course we went with him - I was glad to see the garden and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> delighted to pick oranges and lemons for herself. I have never seen such magnificent lemons - and the oranges were very large and sweet, and we brought away two baskets filled with them. A young man about the garden spoke excellent English having learned at the school at <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName>. The oranges were ornamented with their own handsome leaves. <pb n="80"/>We got too, some huge stalks of <name type="plant" ref="#pampas_grass">Pampas grass</name> - and some trailing branches of the <name type="plant" ref="#loofa">Loofa</name> - a cucurbitous plant, the fruit producing the fibrous sponges known so well in commerce. The dahabeah had floated down to the town by the time we left the garden, and we pulled out to her in the felucca, and from that time until we were called to dinner, we sat on the deck entranced with the wonderful beauty of the evening. The same strange beauty was again repeated in the sky, and reflected in the glassy water, the softest sweetest pink deepening into a turquoise blue - never was there such delicate, luminous, trembling color - it was as if sky, atmosphere and earth were made of liquid opals. The men were quieted by the beauty - and sand their songs softly - and some were at their devotions prostrate. We had not finished dinner before we arrived, and when we went on deck we found ourselves on fete - colored lights swung from the masts and hung about everywhere - and <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Cook Ibrahim</persName> was sending off rockets, which were received with shouts of admiration from the shadowy stretches of the river. We found the "<name type="boat" ref="#Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</name>" lying just behind us. <placeName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</placeName> went off directly with some of the men to the <orgName ref="#Post_Office">Post Office</orgName>, and returned with a large parcel of letters and papers, which we have been busy reading all the evening.</p>

        <p>It was cold this morning, so much so, that we sat for some time after breakfast reading <persName ref="#Galignani_Signor">Galignani</persName>. Then we went for a walk in the town, and wandered about the temple. We are lying against some <pb n="81"/>pleasant fields, a little distance beyond the <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor Hotel</name>. We found it warm enough walking - and when after lunch we mounted our donkeys for <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnak</placeName>, the sun was tremendously hot. I thought we would shrink up in it, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> seemed to feel quite ill. Who can describe <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnak</placeName>, and indeed who would attempt it? We dismounted in the great court and took shelter for awhile in the cool shadows of the wonderful hypostyle hall - with its 129 giant columns. It is the largest hall ever built by the Egyptians, and is the work of that King of builders <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti 1st</persName>. We sat down on some of the great fallen blocks - and we looked and felt like pigmies. Then when we had grown a little too cold for it is always one or the other thing in this climate, we opened <persName ref="#Bey_Mariette">Mariette</persName> and read his description of the temple. I believe the giant monolith of red <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> granite, which stands the taller of the two tall obelisks now left there, impressed me most - it is covered with inscriptions, exquisitely cut. The ride home was very hot, and we found our cool shaded deck, with its easy chairs, and the fragrant tea and coffee which were waiting for us, most comfortable. At 5 o'clock, the thermometer marked 78 in the shade! The evening was wonderful with its exquisite sunset and gorgeous with clouds and color.</p>

        <p>It is just one week since we left our beloved Assouan! We decided last evening to go over to the temple of <placeName ref="#Medinet_Habu">Medinet Abou</placeName> early <pb n="82"/>this morning, and return in time for lunch - and so directly after breakfast we were pulled across the river, after much preparation in the way of veils, payments etc. for the day was hot, and the light intense. The river here is wide, and on the other shore, extremely shallow, so that even a row boat cannot approach it for a distance of from <measure type="distance">75</measure> to <measure type="distance">100 feet</measure> - here the men got out into the water and took us ashore. I put my arms around their necks and was safely landed, and stood laughing at the rest as they were landed in this undignified manner, especially <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> who looked so absurd. We found our equipment of donkeys here, and our saddles, which had been sent across early, on them, and we took our way across the wide sands, then on to a high canal looking down on the green fields, then through an Arab village with its peculiar odour, always reminding us of a dish of curry, then pitching a tremendous incline down to the dry bed of one of the big irrigating canals, and sharply up its opposite bank, we rode along a grove of palms, and then struck into a little bridle path, leading through the pleasant rye and barley fields - though warm, it was most delightful with the great yellow mountains in front of us, with their pinkish shadows sleeping in the hollows - while - could it be true! the great <name type="historical" ref="#Colossi">Colossi</name> of the plains defining themselves in the distance, and growing bigger and bigger! Every one must I think, have the same feeling on first beholding these giants. Are they only melancholy monuments of the glory of a past gigantic art - or do they wait expectantly oblivious of this <pb n="83"/>little present, and of our little selves! Their patient attitude seems to confirm this idea - and one is filled with awe when one gets a dim sense of how they have ben sitting there thousands of years! When a long distance from them, one invests their faces with expression but a nearer view shows them battered and broken - every feature gone. They were originally monoliths - but one of them has been restored with layers of sandstone. They are of breccia, and stood before a temple every vestige of which is gone, and both represent - <persName ref="#Amenophis_III">Amenophis III</persName>. They stood <measure type="distance">60 ft.</measure> high, though now the soil has accumulated more than <measure type="distance">6 ft.</measure> about them - but they are colossal, as we pause under them and ride about them. A little distance on, you strike the desert line, and begin to take your way at the edge of the ancient necropolis - which here at least, must have yielded up all the dead ever committed to its keeping, so full is it of yawning pits and excavations. The reflection of the sun strikes burning hot from the yellow sand, and I am glad enough to take my parasol from the faithful <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName>, who has been running all the time, with my donkey boy by the side of me, with <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> hovering about on his donkey not and then to see if I was properly cared for. <placeName ref="#Medinet_Habu">Medinet Abou</placeName> would be almost as hard to describe as <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnak</placeName>. It is the wonderful monument built by the brilliant <persName ref="#Rameses_III">Ramesses 3rd</persName> to celebrate his victories and achievements - and is preceeded by a small temple of <persName ref="#Thotmes_III">Thotmes 3d</persName> or <persName ref="#Hatasou">Hatasou</persName> - and by the palace or pavilion of <persName ref="#Rameses_III">Ramesses 3d</persName> - which some suppose to have been a royal residence, so unique is its arrangement, but which was more probably a fortress. <pb n="84"/>Here are shield shaped battlemented walls. The grand temple with greater and lesser court, the former with its <name type="historical" ref="#Osiride_pier">Osiride</name> piers on two sides, and great columns on the other, with their unusually deep hieroglyphs and sculptures, with very much of the brilliant blue colouring remaining, was fascinating. One could spend hours and days looking at and studying the sculptured walls, I climbed about as much as I could over the great debris, supported so effectually by <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and one of the men, that I thought my arms would be dislocated! Them we mounted again and rode through the old grove pits, and along the strip of desert land between the mountains and the cultivated plain to the temple of <placeName ref="#Goornah">Goornah</placeName>, built by <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName> to the memory of his father <persName ref="#Rameses_I">Ramesses Ist</persName>. Here the sculptures are most delicate and beautiful, and show the perfection of that culminating period of art. In one of the side chambers is a head of <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName> which is always pointed out, and which is really beautiful in its lines, but which alas! has lost all its colouring through that disgraceful process of 'squeezing". The ride home at high noon through that blazing sun was something rather uncomfortable. We found our little felucca, with its awning and stars and stripes waiting for us, and we were carried out to it, after the usual noisy settling up with guides and donkey men. How deliciously cool and secluded the cabin of the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> seemed to us! The thermometer in the shade of the deck awning marked 78 degrees. In the afternoon we looked at some antiquities in the town - feeling very shy of most of them - knowing that a thriving manufacture of them is driven in <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>.</p>

        <p><pb n="85"/> Orders had been issued last night for an early breakfast, and an immediate start for the <placeName ref="#Tombs_of_Kings">Tombs of the Kings</placeName> - and as I came out of my room this morning, I found <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> striding in and out of the cabin in his riding dress, looking like a handsome brigand, and he made me laugh by saying "Moi, je voyage toujours come un canon"! A cool wind was blowing, but an intense sun shining, against whose too ardent rays we had protected ourselves with veils, parasols and puggarees and blue glasses. The same pleasant crossing in the felucca to the shallow shores beyond, across which we were borne to dry land by our men, as yesterday - then again across the wide stretch of yellow sand to the high embankment, and then the sharp turn at the mud village, filled with troops of little bare bronze children, and then the long ride through the rich barley fields - for the <placeName ref="#Thebes">Theban</placeName> crops are especially rich - we pass the <name type="historical" ref="#Colossi">Colossi</name>, and turn to the right, and riding along the desert edge of this great necropolis, we took our way through and up the path of a mountain torrent which seemed a very valley of desolation - not a living thing - not the faintest trace of vegetable life, or a blade of grass - the sandstone cliffs towering above us on either side, and the sun blazing out upon us from the pitiless sky. What a blinding heat it was, and what a scene of chaotic desolateness! our donkeys picked their way along one after the other with a patient dejection - our men were breathless and perspiring, and I did not like to think of the three girls, almost children who carried the water Page 86: goolaks on their heads and who are always waiting on the bank of the river for tourists, and for a few piasters run along with the donkeys with these jugs on their heads - though far in the rear, they stepped along cheerfully over the sharp stones with their bare feet, and if you looked at one, she would immediately show every tooth she had in a broad smile. Occasionally we pulled up in the 'shadow of a great rock" for a moments rest - and I thought as I am continually doing in this country, how natural the Eastern imagery of the Bible seems! At last we came to a kind of cul de sac in the yellow rocks, where is the tomb of <persName type="historical" ref="#Rameses_IX">Ramesis 9th</persName>, and here we dismounted, for beside seeing the tomb we were going to lunch there. Our patient little donkeys were left in the blinding heat outside, while the men and guides huddled themselves together in the shade of the inclined entrance, while we took possession of the cool, gaily painted portal - our sumpter mule was unpacked, rugs laid down, camp stools and table spread, and an elaborate lunch ready. Our three little water carriers squatted near us - girls not over 9 or 10 years of age - pretty things they all were, with their beautiful eyes, white teeth and pleasant voices. One of them called <persName ref="#Fatima">Fatima</persName> so endeared herself to <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName>, that she has promised to come to the dahabeah tomorrow, to be painted. After our lunch, we lingered and rested until four o'clock - afraid to venture out in the heat - and we walked down the descending corridor of the tomb examining the strange paintings. Then we went a short distance to the well known and often described <name type="historical" ref="#tomb_of_Seti_I">tomb of <persName type="historical" ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName></name> commonly called "<name type="historical" ref="#Belzonis_Tomb"><choice><sic>Belgonè</sic><corr>Belzoni</corr></choice>'s Tomb</name>", from the fact that <pb n="87"/> he opened it in 1817. He found that it had already been rifled, but that very little injury had been done to the paintings - which is more than can be said of it now - as savants and tourists share the odium of its present defaced state. It is the most remarkable thing - cut into the solid rock, 470 feet - along the gradual descent of the corridor we went the light from the entrance growing dimmer and dimmer, until we came to a steep broken staircase, the lower part of it lost in black darkness - then all our candles were lighted, and with <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mahomed</persName>'s help stumbled down it until we came to a room, then down another staircase and finally plunged into the yawning blackness of another - the candles flickering and trowing strange lights on the brilliant paintings and hieroglyphs which cover every part of the halls and chambers. Strange monsters and huge serpents writhe along the walls, and guard the entrances. The cheerful realistic representations of every day human life, which the tombs of the earliest dynasties show, are not here. In their place, evil demons and shapes represent the more modern ideas, of the struggle of the soul with evil - and on these walls the whole elaborate story of the judgement and trial of the soul after death is given - Anything more strangely impressive than these great chambers in the heart of the mountain, with their brilliant and elaborate decoration, cannon be imagined. And the thought of the amount and difficulty of the labour, was overpowering. What a commentary too, are these strange tombs, hid away in this wild and almost inaccessible valley, on the stability of human effort and ambition! To think of these right Page 88: royal old kings, supreme in their power and pride fashioning and decorating their tombs through life and securing as they imagined their regal bodies from desecration, their secret burial, the building up and concealment of the entrance after burial, and it is said, the killing of the priests and all who knew of its location - and, in some after time of danger and emergency, the careful gathering of all the bodies, and their transference to the deep well like tomb where they were found a few years since, and conveyed to the <orgName ref="#Boulaq_Museum">Boulak museum</orgName>, and now lie open to the gaze of the tourist of the 19th century! It is thought now that the temples known as <placeName ref="#Medinet_Habu">Medinet Abou</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Ramesseum">the Ramesseum</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Goornah">Temple of Goornah</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Der_el_Bahari">Deir-el-Bahari</placeName> etc., which stand along this great stretch of desert land, lying along the mountains here, separated by no great intervals, so that one can easily be seen from the other, are the <name type="historical" ref="#Mastaba">Mastabas</name>, or mortuary chapels of their kings, buried beyond and above them in the valley of the <placeName>Bab-el-Moulak.</placeName></p>
        <p>On coming out of the tomb of <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti 1st</persName>, we went to that of <persName ref="#Rameses_III">Ramesis 3d</persName> or <placeName ref="#Bruns_Tomb">Brun's Tomb</placeName> as it is often called, or the <placeName ref="#Bruns_Tomb">Tomb of the Harpists</placeName>, from the admirable paintings so well known of two men playing harps. The finish and execution of this tomb is far inferior to that of <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName>. Here as at <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName> are numerous Greek "graffiti", showing that they were open to the inspection of travellers in the times of the Ptolemies. Our ride down the valley was much more pleasant in the cool of the afternoon, and we stopped at the <placeName ref="#Ramasseum">Ramasseum</placeName> and rode about it, seeing it very well in this way. The most gigantic <pb n="89"/> statues known, lies here fallen and broken. It is of granite and represents <persName ref="#Rameses_II">Ramasses 2d</persName>. Of all these temples or mortuary chapels, this one seems the most cheerful, standing as it does without any enclosing walls, and few encumbering Roman and <orgName ref="Copts">Coptic</orgName> ruins, which give such an air of squalid desolation, with their masses of crude crumbling bricks.</p>

        <p>This morning being very warm, and we rather tired from the long expedition of yesterday, felt very little energy. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> was to stay at home of course, and paint little <persName ref="#Fatima">Fatima</persName>, for whom the sailors went across the river while we were at breakfast - she arrived in due time, but what with her eyes all blackened, and many gew-gaw ornaments she did not look the pretty child she did yesterday.

In the afternoon <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> declining all guides and attendants, rode off to <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnac</placeName>, and home in time for dinner - while I lounged about the deck with my book, enjoying everything. We are moored to a high bank, along the top of which the usual road or path runs - and along this people are coming and going continually - tourists, and fellaheans - camels and donkeys. Just above us on the bank, M.S. has pitched his beautiful tent - and at different levels of the bank are our belongings in the way of chicken <pb n="90"/> coops - picketted turkeys and a lamb - <persName ref="#Tommy">Tommy</persName>'s little cook stove - drying clothes etc. etc. This evening old <persName ref="#Mohassib_Mohammed">Mahommed Mohassib</persName> appeared a really interesting old man, speaking English imperfectly but intelligibly - with such a gentle respectful manner. I am beginning to look upon him in the light of a friend. He was very mysterious at first, and I felt that something was in the air, and he presently explained that two very fine mummy cases and some papyrus had come into his possession that day, which had been taken out of a tomb only the day before, and if the governor would like to see them, he would send for them. A young son of his whom he is bringing up to the business was with him, and he was despatched for the things - and after awhile returned with a man, bringing in a huge, mystic looking black parcel, from which were taken the heads of two fine mummy cases, and a basket of papyrus, which seemed to have been hastily stripped from the mummy case, as particles of it were still adhering to the case. It was very much broken, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> after some haggling bought them all - and the heads were transferred to the top of the big locker in my room. I had them however tied up in paper, as they are a little too suggestive uncovered, for sleepy observation. I must not neglect mentioning the rather insignificant addition to our party, in the shape of a tourtourelle, bought when we were going up the river for half a piastre from a native who had brought the little unfledged thing to the boat. <persName ref="#Georgette">Georgette</persName> undertook the care and nurture of it - and we named him <persName ref="#Mena">Mena</persName> after the first historical king. He has grown and thrived and is now quite a <pb n="91"/> character, and insists upon being present when we eat, and has a special predelection for the buiscuit that are served for afternoon tea, and he sometimes grows very impatient for it, flies into the room, and on to the table, running up and down, fluttering his wings, and saying, "Why don"t you hurry up that tea".</p>

        <p>Another very warm day, and we devoted the morning to hunting antiquities. At one of the shops we fell in with an Englishman by the name of <persName ref="#Chester">Chester</persName>, who has spent 21 winters in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - and has some accurate knowledge of antiquities - as he buys for the <orgName ref="#British_Museum">British Museum</orgName>, and <orgName ref="#Ashmolean_Museum">Ashmolean</orgName> in <placeName ref="#Oxford">Oxford</placeName> - he had promised to come and look at our purchases. Then we went to <persName ref="#Mohassib_Mohammed">Mohammed Mohassibs</persName>, and bought some things. These men never keep their best things on exhibition - nor do they produce them unless they are very sure of their customers. They keep them in safe hiding either in or out of the house. This morning <persName ref="#Mohassib_Mohammed">Mohassib</persName> took us into a small back room up stairs - with a bed in it, and lifting one of the mattresses showed us two long mummy cloths with figures and inscriptions on them. They were from the mummies of <persName ref="#Amenhotep_III">Amenophis 3d</persName> and his <persName ref="#Tyii">queen</persName> - and he asked $700 in our money, or 3500 francs for them. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> has a knowledge of these things, and pronounces generally as to what is spurious and genuine, and keeps an eagle eye on us, to see that we are not cheated - and when he says quietly, "you don"t want that Governor", <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> will not buy. These <pb n="92"/>cloths were genuine, no doubt, and the query was, how were they found? Had the tomb of this kind lately been opened? and where are the other valuable things? It is very stirring and exciting to think of the constant digging and searching among the tombs across the river. Every Arab in <placeName ref="#Kurna">Goornah</placeName> I am told spends his night in this way. It is against all law - the government allows no digging or excavations - but they seem powerless to prevent it. It would be difficult to put such extensive territory under sufficient guard - and they have not the money to undertake thorough and intelligent excavations themselves. I feel in a rage about it when I think of it. In the meantime hundreds of hands are surreptitiously at work at it - valuable things are destroyed and injured by hasty and forbidden search. The beautiful, highly ornamented mummy head of a woman that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought, has had the back of it torn hastily off, and what has become of the rest of the case, and the mummy with its valuable things folded in its wrappings! These men dare not offer what they find, for sale openly - either they have to part with them at a moderate price, to two or three dealers in <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, who in their turn secrete them until a safe and advantageous opening offers itself - or - they sometimes make a secret sale directly to the tourist. It is soon known among this thieving fraternity, that a tourist is anxious to buy good things, and willing to pay for them - and this accounts for the one or two mysterious men, who are constantly squatting on the bank near us, and who if he catches the eye of us holds up some bag or packet to attract our curiousity. But <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> <pb n="93"/> and the <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Captain</persName> ignore them, and they are are not allowed to be present themselves - and we do not notice them. We had intended this afternoon about 4 to row down to <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnac</placeName>, <measure quantity="2" unit="mile" type="distance">2 miles</measure> from here, and then ride over to the temples - but just as we were having tea on deck, <persName ref="#Chester">Mr. Chester</persName> appeared and stayed some time talking and looking at our purchases. He says the papyrus is a portion of the <title ref="#Ritual_Of_Book_Of_Dead">Ritual of the Book of the Dead</title>, but as there may be some other matter with it, advises <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">T.</persName> to submit it to an expert in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>, and says he will give him a card of introduction to the head of the Egyptian department of the <orgName ref="#Boulaq_Museum">Museum</orgName>. After he went away, we had only time for a charming row of a mile or two. There are several dahabeahs here now - some bound up, and four like ourselves bound down, <persName ref="#Chester">Mr. Chesters</persName> among the number. It looks very pretty and gay. After dinner <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> came to us and asked if we would like to go up to his tent on the bank, as he had someone reading the <title ref="#Quran">Koran</title> there - and explained that when at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> he always had this done. So up we went, and found chairs had been carried up for us and rugs - and sat for half an hour listening to three men seated on a rug, singing or intoning the <title ref="#Quran">Koran</title>, with that swinging of the body which seems to be necessary to a recital of the <title ref="#Quran">Koran</title>, Several Arabs were gathered about the door of the tent, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais Achmed</persName> were sitting on the ground in devout attitudes, occasionally responding to the reading by a slowly drawn out "Allah". The principal reader would recite incredibly fast for a time, then one or other of the men on either side of him would take it up, beginning in a strange high falsetto tone, <pb n="94"/> and sinking to the level of the intonation - occasionally breaking out in the same high key again. It was a strange, and lovely scene - through the tent door the broad river below us lay in one silver sheen of moonlight, and far away glimmered the chain of western hills, which still hide in their stony bosoms so many secrets we would like to know, and which have witnessed centuries ago, so many burial ceremonies of the great and royal dead.</p>

        <p>This has been a lazy and delightful day. it has been hot - and this morning we walked in the town, or rather the rest did while I had a donkey. We went again through the temple. In the afternoon, I stayed quietly at home - and about 4, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> crossed the river, and visited <placeName ref="#Medinet_Habu">Medinet Abou</placeName>, returning by moonlight. They pronounced it a charming time of day to see the ruins to the best advantage. This evening we have had our second "fantasia" - and very pretty we were with our palm decked boat, and the coloured lights from bow to stem, and up and down the rigging - with <orgName ref="Bengal_lights">Bengal lights</orgName> and occasional rockets, and a large, if not very select audience along the bank. We are to make one last excursion across the river tomorrow - for alas! the days at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> must come to an end, as did those at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>.</p>

        <p>An early start across the river for a last visit to <placeName ref="#Medinet_Habu">Medinet Abou</placeName> - the sun, however was hours before us, and I thought we should <pb n="95"/>have been shrivelled up by its burning rays - but, in spite of it, the beautiful ride had its charms, across the green fragrant fields, with the golden mountains beyond, and the <name type="historical" ref="#Colossi">Colossi</name> sitting in their eternal strangeness on the border of the desert. After wandering and looking about sometime, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> brought up an Arab who he said was a man to be trusted, and who had dealt for years in antiquities, etc. etc. We were conducted to the seclusion of one of the side chambers, and posting <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName> at the entrance to give us warning of the coming of anyone, the Arab produced from some of the inner depths of his dress an exquisite little wooden statuette about 3 inches high of a naked boy with the side lock worn by young princes, with hieroglyphs and scrolls on the base - reminding me of the wooden statuettes I had seen in the <orgName ref="#Boulaq_Museum">Boulak</orgName> two years ago. The price he demanded was enormous, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> would not give it. He swore he had found it three days before at <placeName ref="#El_Assassif">El Assassif</placeName>, a certain part of the necropolis. We were then taken to a tomb lately excavated near the <placeName ref="#Ramesseum">Ramesseum</placeName> - the paintings were brilliantly fresh, though they were two thousand or more years old - but very crude. There were two chambers - and the heat in them was intense. Our guide said he would like to own this tomb for a home to live in! all his people lived in tombs he said - they were cooler in summer and warmer in winter. We then paid a farewell visit to the <placeName ref="#Ramesseum">Ramesseum</placeName>, and rode home in time for lunch - in the afternoon going to some very amusing races, got up by the English club at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> - camel - buffalo - donkey races - and amusing matches - a large concourse of people - so many tourists <pb n="96"/> plainly telling of the presence of one of <persName ref="#Cook_Thomas">Cook</persName>'s steamers. I had a donkey going and coming - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> made a long detour through the town home, while I under the care of <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> and two of the men, came directly home, passing on the <persName ref="#Nikolaevich_Peter">Grand Duke Peter</persName> and his <persName ref="#Nikolaevich_Militza">wife</persName> of <placeName ref="#Russia">Russia</placeName>, who are spending the winter at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor Hotel</name>, nice, ordinary looking young people. This evening who should ask entrance but the Arab dealer of the morning, who brought his young prince which <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought at a great reduction from the original price.</p>

        <p> Our last morning at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> found us very busy, immediately after breakfast <persName ref="#Beato_Antonio">Beato</persName>, the photographer came to take the picture of our men and dahabeah. The sun was intensely hot, the awnings having to be lifted, he was in a great hurry to get back to his atelier and everybody seemed excessively stupid about it. After he had gone <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> strolled into the the town which he reported very quiet and stupid, as all the dahabeahs but two, and <persName ref="#Cook_Thomas">Cook's</persName> steamers had gone off early. After lunch we went to sit on the deck in the shade of a narrow awning, while preparations were made to get away, and about 3 o'clock we put off, firing a farewell gun, and receiving a parting salute - as we were well going and had passed the post office, a man came out and shouted there was a letter for <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> - so we pulled up and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> went ashore in the felucca, returning in a few minutes indignant, as the letter had proved to be for some one on an English dahabeah. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> <pb n="97"/>was particularly ruffled - he stalked the deck, his eyes flashing and said in plain English, "that man is one damn fool". "Why Mahommed" I said, " I didn"t know you had learned that kind of English," and with the pleasant laugh so characteristic of him, he said, "Yes, <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Madame</persName>, he is one damn fool"! We dropped down the river as far as the pleasant beach at <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnac</placeName> - where donkeys were waiting for us, and soon rode off through the village, which is rather pretty with its palms, acacias, and scent trees, but it swarms with dirty, naked children who pursued us demanding baksheesh - and with wolfish looking dogs snarling and barking at us from the roofs and walls. The vastness and gigantic size of the ruined temples impressed me more today than before - where else, can such a confusion of mightly ruins be found? We stood in the great hall of columns of <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName>, for the last time, and looked up at the gigantic far away capitals, against the soft blue sky - they represent the expanded lotus flower, and their enormous edges seem almost to touch - many of them still brilliant in color -and on each side vista after vista of great columns, and we amongst them seemed like insignificant atoms. As everywhere in these Egyptian temples, and in a greater degree here, the mind is oppressed with the thought of the enforced toil and labour necessary to such achievement, of the thousands of toiling workmen, slaves and captives, and in such a climate. By good right, these vast halls should be haunted continually by their wails of suffering and despair - and how stupendous the might, and how insolent the power of those old kings, who could command such results! <pb n="98"/>The ride home in the gloaming through the fragrant fields was delighful, and when we reached the bank of the river, the <placeName>Nubia</placeName> with her bright lights lying below, looked such a pleasant welcome to us. <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mohammed Ali</persName> came out with the lantern to light us down the rough bank, and two or three others came to lead my donkey down and help me to dismount, and <persName ref="#Rais_Achmed">Rais Achmed</persName> with the rest about him, stood ready to help us in. Always on coming home in this way there are so many brown hands held out to help and welcome, that I always think of the the line from that sweet hymn "yet there are hands stretched out to draw me near". <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> had been counting upon going once more to the temple by moonlight - but alas! the moon hid herself behind clouds - and there was nothing to do but stay at home - play our game of dominoes, and write our journals!</p>

After two or three hours of rowing, the men gave it up, and we drifted helplessly with wind and current until lunch, when the motion being so great, we tied up to the bank, so that we might eat in peace.

        <p>We went hard and fast upon a sand bank last night, within sight of <placeName ref="#Balyana_Al">Balliana</placeName>, and after much effort got off, but anchored where we were, as the night was very dark, and came up to the town early this morning. We found the "<name type="boat" ref="#Eva">Eva</name>" a big dahabeah with two or three American men, which lay near us several days at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, lying here just behind us. She is the nicest most luxuriant boat we have seen on the river. The morning was overcast which made it very pleasant for us, and we were soon in our saddles riding through the clean picturesque town, and out upon the wide green fields, bound for <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos</placeName> <measure quantity="6" unit="mile" type="distance">6 miles</measure> or more away. The valley here is very wide, from <measure type="distance">6-9 miles</measure> and the crops exceedingly rich - from the river to the foot of the desert land, barley, wheat, lupins etc. stand in unbroken luxuriance. At regular distances, rude pedestals of mud and straw, some four feet high are placed, on which <pb n="100"/>men were sitting guarding the crops. What a delicious morning it was, and what a charming ride, through that soft air, fragrant with the blossoming crops. At one time the rain fell smartly, and we had to put up our umbrellas. All along the narrow path through the fields, men, women, children, buffaloes, camels etc. were hurrying to the market at the town of <placeName ref="#Arabet_Abydos">Arabat</placeName>, which is built over the mounds of old <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos</placeName>, they made pretty pictures streaming along one after the other - and we were obliged to turn out of our way sometimes to avoid the camels. Just at the edge of this town stands the temple of <persName ref="#Seti_I">Seti Ist</persName> that prince of builders, its exquisite sculptures making it the most beautiful temple in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>. Here we spent the morning and lunched - and our lunch table was spread in the narrow corridor on one of the walls of which, the famous tablet of <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos</placeName> is sculptured - containing a list of the kings beginning with <persName ref="#Mena">Menes</persName>, and ending with <persName ref="#Seti">Seti</persName>. We chose the semi-darkness of this corridor, dirty and dusty as it was, as a high wind had sprung up, driving the dust in a blinding fashion. It fortunately fell however before we started out in the blinding heat for a visit to the little that remains of the splendid temple of <persName ref="#Rameses_II">Ramesses 2d</persName>. We did not undertake the ride further on to the tombs of <placeName ref="#Kom_El_Sultan">Kom-es-Sultan</placeName> - a locality which disputes with <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName> to contain the tomb of <persName ref="#Osiris">Osiris</persName>. So we turned home for the long ride back - and as we passed the <name type="boat" ref="#Eva">Eva</name>, looked down upon her cool shaded deck, where the men were smoking, and felt ourselves very hot and dusty. By 5 o'clock we were off, making the distance, in spite of the wind to <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Girgeh</placeName>, about dark, <pb n="101"/>a distance of <measure quantity="8" unit="mile" type="distance">8 miles</measure>. We sat on deck, watching the play of distant lightning. Just as we landed a sharp north wind began to blow, which looks ominous for our progress tomorrow. A <persName ref="#Cook_Thomas">Cook's</persName> steamer, and two dahabeahs are lying here, and this evening <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> had the audacity to visit the former.</p>

A wretched little donkey was found, so small that I could almost sit down upon him without help, and as thin as he was small. But he protested in plainest language against the saddle, so another was fetched, a little bigger but no less miserable, who in his turn protested against the bit, so it was taken out, and he was ignominiously led or rather dragged and as he frequently stumbled, it was just as well for me that he had a stout man to support him. We went through the uninteresting bazaar, and through the market where a fair was in progress, and a merry go round, and conjurors were busy. We paused for a few moments on the outside of a large circle of people who were gathered about a 'story teller". I would much have liked to have understood what he said, the crowd were following his words and movements with an undivided attention. Then <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> took me to the door of an old <placeName>Mosque</placeName>, which he said I would not be allowed to enter, some peculiar sanctity forbidding a a woman to <pb n="102"/>enter there. Clearly woman has but little place in the Mohammedan scheme of religion. Some men lounging on the top of the flight of steps seemed inclined to resent my even looking in - but <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> in a lofty manner rather wiped them away and I had a glimpse into the dusky interior, with its walls quite covered with most lovely old blue and white <orgName ref="#Saracen">Saracenic</orgName> tiles. <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Girgeh</placeName> is an important town with 13,000 inhabitants, and shows one beautiful minaret.</p>

We are now tied up for the night near a little mud village with a background of palms - and quite a long level bit of beach. After we were made fast, I got out and walked up and down, followed by a crowd of naked and ragged children, shrieking in their pleasant little voices - "baksheesh <orgName ref="#Howadji">Howadji</orgName>" - "baksheesh <orgName ref="#Howadji">Howadji</orgName>". Flocks are coming home from the fields - camels - donkeys, buffaloes and goats - women carrying water from the river - a fire seen here and there in the village, with its blue smoke rising. The wind is rough tonight - the rudder squeaks - and the felucca bangs against us, and the tired men are all asleep.</p>

        <p>A morning of delightful calm.

We showed our beautiful Sphinx and little prince, with both of which he seemed properly impressed - and said the former would grace any European Museum. He was most alarming however in his predictions of custom house dangers.</p>

        <p>Another calm morning. Our good sailors brought us to <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName> about noon. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> has been so much bored by our slow progress, that <pb n="104"/>he takes our movements with the most gloomy limitations - and soon after breakfast when I saw through the glass the trees and minarets of <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiout</placeName>, and announced my discovery, I was laughed to scorn, and he offered to bet $1000 lbs. I was wrong. But here we are! Soon after lunch we mounted our donkeys and went to the <orgName ref="#American_Mission">American Mission</orgName> taking our spare books and magazines to <persName ref="#Alexandre_Mr #Alexandre_Mrs">Mr. And Mrs. Alexandre</persName>. (I wonder what they will think of "<title ref="#John_Ward_Preacher">John Ward, Preacher</title>".) We took <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName> with us, so that <persName ref="#Alexandre_Mr">Mr.Alexandre</persName> could explain to him what <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> was willing to do with him in the way of schooling, if he wished to accept it. But I think the idea is too big for him. We found the four little <persName ref="#Alexandre_Mr #Alejandre_Mrs">Alexandres</persName> pale, recovering from diphtheria. After a pleasant call we said goodbye, and rode up the Mountain to the the justly celebrated view of the wide plain. While the rest climbed to the very top, I sat still on my donkey, content with the beautiful scene stretched out below me. The wide valley so richly cultivated, the picturesque town with its mosques, domes and minarets lay bathed in a delicious afternoon light. The air was crisp - like one of our early spring days, and fragrant with blossoming crops - coming home, we passed a funeral procession - the women wailing as usual. One middle aged woman following the bier, was sobbing with such heart felt sobs - it was the sound of a heart truly bereft!</p>

        <p>The <!-- book ref tags? -->"Rudder Grange" was close by our side when <persName ref= "#Georgette">Georgette</persName> drew my curtains this morning, and the lofty cliffs of <placeName ref="#Abu_Fudah_Jabal">Gebel Abou-faydah</placeName> were towering above our heads. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> reported at breakfast, that we had only made <measure type="distance">four miles</measure> from last nights anchorage - and the wind was already blowing hard. After breakfast <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went ashore and joined <persName ref="#Chester">Mr. Chester</persName> for a stroll along the cliffs - while <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I stayed on deck, watching through the glass the numerous birds who make their nests in the crevices of the rocks - sometimes we would swing so near to these perpendicular cliffs, as almost to touch. The wind blew harder and harder - and we made for the opposite shore which was low and sandy, and there made fast. Mr. <persName ref="#Chester">Chester</persName> followed us, and he and <persName ref="#Cooper_Mr">Mr. Cowper</persName> came in their small boat to pay us a visit, and we asked them to stay to lunch, which they did - so that the dull day was most pleasantly broken.

We are about <measure type="distance">4 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Manfalût">Manfaloot</placeName>. All the afternoon the wind howled, and the sand flew.

        <p> Last night was really awful. In the evening the Captain found we were sinking too much in the soft sand, and with great difficulty worked us out 50 ft. from shore where we anchored - though the current was strong, the wind was so violent, that our bow faced down stream, and in the fluctuations of the wind, we would turn a little and then back again, bringing up with a jerk on the anchor. After getting into bed and trying to sleep for two hours, I gave it up and lighted my candle, which burned until half past two o'clock. What with the wind, the tramping and rushing about of the sailors, the banging of boats and rudder, sleep was impossible - the crew were up all night, and <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">R&#228;is Achmed</persName> was only too thankful to pull out from our dangerous position when the wind lulled, an hour before daylight.

        <p>Our slumbers last night were rather disturbed by our guards who seemed to think <!-- "it is" or "it"? correction -->it necessary to fire off a rifle now and then as a warning to the neighborhood - for several nights now, we have had three or four men on guard. We awakened to a calm lovely day, though a very warm one. The men rowed vigourously, and brought us to <placeName ref="#Bani_Hassan">Beni Hassan</placeName> soon after eleven o'clock. Lunch was hurried, donkeys commanded by stentorian lungs from the dahabeah, and by 12 o'clock we were in the felucca for the opposite shore, where donkeys, two soldiers with their rifles, and a vociferating crowd of the most villainous looking Arabs I ever saw, were waiting for us. The whole neighborhood of <placeName ref="#Bani_Hassan">Beni Hassan</placeName> has had a most evil reputation for years - and some years ago the old village of <placeName ref="#Bani_Hassan">Beni Hassan</placeName> was destroyed by order of the Government because of the thieving and turbulent character of its people - and from what we heard and saw of the inhabitants of the present village, the same heroic remedy should be resorted to, in regard to them. Certainly a more wicked and howling cortige than we had, I never saw. The soldiers must have accompanied us as a decoration, as they seemed incapable of quieting the donkey men and guides - and were utterly wanting in anything like dignity - and there was a constant exchange of hostilities between them. I saw one of the guides take a soldier by the neck and spin him almost off his feet. I expected to see him use his rifle, and I now have doubts of <pb n="108"/> the rifles being loaded. Our donkeys were the most wretched of their race, and as we took our way over the hot arid stoney path, we hoped the pilgrimage would soon be over. <measure type="distance" unit="mile">Two miles</measure> of it took us up to a lofty plateau from which a most enchanting view was had of the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> valley for miles up and down the river. How brilliantly green the narrow ribbon like strips of cultivated land looked, with its frame of desert on either side! Arrived at the tombs, another shrieking scrimmage went on, while we waited indignant until the various guides settled some difficulty among themselves.</p>
        <p>These <placeName ref="#Bani_Hassan">Beni Hassan</placeName> tombs of the 12th dynasty, marking one of the finest periods of art in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>, are so well known - every ordinary student of art is familiar with their graceful and elegant columns, prototypes of the Grecian Doric order of centuries later. The paintings too, are wonderfully rich in variety, and form with the tomb of <persName ref="#Tiye">Ti</persName> at <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName> the richest sources of all our knowledge of Egyptian life and manners of the earlier dynasties. But alas! how disappointing the actual sight of them! Such is the ruin caused, not by time, but by the ruthless hands of travellers from earliest times to our own. It is impossible to make out many of the figures, only familiarity with their representations in books, make them decipherable and the columns chipped and hacked, their bases almost wanting. It is hideous to think of it. One piece of vandalism dates but a few months back, and shows a square chasm in the stone, with its fresh surface. Since then, for the first time, these tombs have been placed under the care of guards. The thing that best repaid us was the wide outlook over that strange <pb n="109"/> country. It was so hot however, and our surroundings were so disagreeable that we only paused for a few moments after leaving the grottoes, for a look about us, but hurried down by a shorter and pleasanter way, avoiding the town, to the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> which had dropped down the river <measure type="distance" unit="miles">3 miles</measure> and lay waiting for us. Several of our men came out some distance to meet us, and it was delightful to see their pleasant smiles of welcome and protection. When we arrived we found an audience of the same villainous looking men squatting about, and the <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name> several feet from shore, at the extreme limit of her gang plank. We were glad to dismount and take refuge in the cool and shady cabin. A tremendous row began when <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> made his settlement with the guides, donkey men and soldiers - and when they saw signs of departure, several of them sprang into the water, and held the boat, our men unceremoniously took in the gang plank with 3 men on it, giving them a fine dip in the water - and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> put some cartridges in his pocket, and took his gun, and sat down in a conspicuous position with it, on the upper deck. At last we were off in the lovely, quiet afternoon, and sped away with a light wind and a fast current down to <placeName ref="#Al_Minya">Minieh</placeName>, where we are now lying, reading the letters and papers we found waiting for us in the P.O. This morning at breakfast, it being <persName ref="#Washington_George">Washington</persName>'s birthday I idly spoke of it to <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> as one of our national "jours de fete", and he immediately hurried out with that childish eastern pleasure in small things, to warn the cook - as a consequence we had a particularly elaborate dinner, and an extraordinary construction in the way of a cake covered with pink icing, and resting in a nest of bonbons - crowned by a standard <pb n="110"/> with an attempt at an American flat at the top - all the handiwork of <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Cook Ibrahim</persName>. This, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> deposited on the table with a grand manner, saying, "C"est le gateau pour <persName ref="#Washington_Martha">M. Washington"</persName>. I plunged into it with a knife when the time came, and we found it a most uneatable mass of sponge cake and confiture, deadly sweet, so under cover of giving the crew a part in one National holiday, we sent most of it out to them, which they greatly enjoyed - and "Mr. Washington's flag" adorns our prow, to the great amusement of the crew.</p>

        <p>A lovely calm, warm morning, developed a fine south wind, and we have made a splendid run of <measure quantity="50" unit="mile">50 miles</measure>, and are now lying <measure quantity="106" unit="mile">106 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. It has been a relief to see the men having a day of rest from their oars. The afternoon was enchanting, with a yellow sunset sky - the pink and blue colours filling all the east, and reflected in the calm water - the young moon now four days old making quite a radiance. We were on deck all the time - our white well filled sail carrying us swiftly through this scene of beauty. In the morning we had an exciting time - we had reached a place where the river spread broadly out, and as it is now quite low, there are seen as well as unseen sand banks - and a dozen or more working boats tacking backwards and forwards in the light wind - collision after collision seemed imminent, and only by the efforts of our giant <!--Do we know this person's name?-->second Captain, sided by the crew, prevented one of these heavy boats colliding with us - such shrieking and dashing about, and such grunts and groans from our <pb n="111"/> men as they actually put themselves as bumpers between the boats. We left a large part of our red and white streamer on the mast of another boat. Cooks new big steamer "<name type="boat" ref="#Rameses">Rameses the Great</name>" came along in the midst of it, and stopping for a moment, chose another channel and went safely through. Then came a small Egyptian steamer, which went bravely on a sand bank and stuck there, until sometime in the afternoon I suppose, as she passed us just before evening.</p>

Not often after a hard days row, do they sing now - but after their supper wrap themselves in their rugs, and let us hope, lie down to pleasant dreams - more likely to a dreamless sleep.</p>

        <p>A calm hot day - our men have worked magnificently, and we are now about <measure type="distance">12 miles</measure> of <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. We have packed and settled a great many things and have spent most of the day on deck in spite of the heat. The <placeName ref="#Meidum_Pyramid">Meydoum pyramid</placeName> appeared early this morning - then <placeName ref="#Dahshūr">Dashour</placeName> and finally the well know outlines of <placeName ref="#Giza">Gizeh</placeName> - and I began to realize that the delicious <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> life was over. It made us very uncomfortable to see the men sitting in the intense sunlight hour after hour working <pb n="113"/> so hard - but they have all felt it to be the last day, and were under the excitement of the last spurt. The <!--correction needed later?-->2d captain stood at his helm like a splendid bronze statue - and had piles of shawls and cloaks on top of his head for protection. Occasionally he would descend to the lower deck and take the place of some weary sailor for a time, and it seemed as if his magnificent strength told at once and he would put new life in the crew. The singer sang his best songs continually, and got off some extraordinary vocal gymnastics. <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> even took a hand at the oars once in a while - and two or three times <persName ref="#Rais_Achmed">R&#228;is Achmed</persName> took a pull himself. About 5 o'clock a fine south wind came up - both sails were hoisted - the tired men put away their oars - the hatches went down, and we were glad to see them resting. We had hoped to stop at <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName> for a day - but we are too much behind time. I have told <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> some days ago, that when we got into <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> I should give the men a good dinner - with the idea of which they are well pleased.

        <p>We arrived at 9 o'clock this morning - the quiet south wind of last night has increased and developed into a respectable kamseen, as we drew up beneath the high encircling walls of a palace enclosure <pb n="114"/> on the <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> side, the waves were rushing past us, and the driving wind carried everything movable before it. General and formal congratulations were exchanged amongst all, from <persName ref="#Achmed_Rais">Rais Achmed</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> down to the crew on our safe arrival. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> at once went ashore and drove into town for our mail, and to secure rooms and money. While <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I, having survived the misery of dismantling the dahabeah, and watched the last disposition of our many belongings, and newly acquired possessions and antiquities, went on deck where the close awnings protected us from the stifling hot wind. Before I was ready to leave the cabin, <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName> came and said the men were at their dinner, but they would not eat until I came out. Surprised at the celerity of the preparations for the feast, and the hour chosen, I went out and found the lower deck enclosed with its awnings, a veritable table occupying most of it, and the men actually seated in chairs and on benches about it! looking so conscious and silly, but as happy as children. They rose at once, all their white teeth shining in their smiling brown faces, and began a triple cheer, led off by <!--How to add accented e?--><persName ref="#Esne">Esne</persName>, ending with "tink you, tink you, my lady" repeated again and again, and followed by some undistinguishable English sentence, in which, I suppose, <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> had coached them. Then they sat down and began devouring such a meal as they never had before. There were platters of good meat and vegetables up and down the table - two chickens, good bread, a great pudding of rice and milk, oranges and coffee - and I don't think a grain of rice, or a shred of meat was left on the table. Then they had cigarettes, and renewed <pb n="115"/> cheering - and <!--How to add accented e?--><persName ref="#Esne">Esne</persName> made a dance around the table, and up the gangway to thank me again, with his wild gesticulations. I was so sorry <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> missed the pleasant sight. He and <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">M.S.</persName> soon came back, with a huge mail, and the unsatisfactory news that we must go for the night to the <!--Correct tag?--><name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Continental_Hotel">Continental Hotel</name> - as our rooms at <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepheards_Hotel">Shepheards</name> would not be ready until tomorrow. Then began the distribution of money and presents to all the men - after which ceremony all our possessions were transferred to carts and carriages, we bade a melancholy farewell to all, and took one last fond look at the gallant little <name type="boat" ref="#Nubia">Nubia</name>, which had been our home for two months - and about which so many interesting and delightful memories will always cling. Each man as we said goodbye and shook hands, carried our hands near but not to the mouth, and then to the forehead, and their "good bye Sitt" I shall not soon forget. <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mahomet Ali</persName> and <persName ref="#Jacoub">Jacoub</persName> went with us to the hotel, and worked like Trojans. <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> could hardly be seen as we drove along the streets, the hot wind was driving so much dust along the streets - and the ladies in the cool marble courts and corridors of this very pleasant looking hotel, were in their silks and muslins.</p>

The space and beauty of their present quarters is a great contrast to the limited old quarters at <orgName ref="#Boulaq_Museum">Boulak</orgName>.

After an early breakfast, we drove directly to <placeName ref="#Giza">Gizeh</placeName>, to a private dealer in antiquities, where we stayed until 12 o'clock, bringing home some charming things.

        <p>We arrived this morning by the night train from <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName>, travelling in a coupe lit for the first time, which though not very comfortable is really less tiresome and fatiquing than the long day journey. My prophetic fears about the voyage across the <placeName ref="#Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</placeName> were only too well fulfilled. We found a delightfully clean little ship, with not too many passengers. <persName ref="#Nott_Major">Major Nott</persName> and his family and <persName ref="#Sampson_Mr">Mr. Sampson</persName>, of <orgName ref="#Sampson_Low_and_Co_London">Sampson, Low and Co.

We had one good day and <pb n="119"/> night, but on the second evening a gale began to blow, which has hardly stopped, then followed two most wretched days and nights. The ship pitched and rolled tremendously - <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> was very ill in her room all the time - and I stopped in my berth, afraid to venture out - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Nott_Major">Major Nott</persName> were among the few who were not ill.

We went through the Pompeian rooms - they were filled with the usual Sunday crowd of peasants and small people - and although they were odorous, and not to be approached too nearly, I was much interested in their quiet, and genuinely hearty interest in every thing they saw. The American sailor boys were there in full force - as three ships of the <!--tag?-->"White Squadron" as it is called over here, are in port at <placeName ref="#Castelamore">Castelamore</placeName>.

They were all numbered and lay on shelves around the room. There were 3 or 4 glass cases standing on supports in the middle of the room, containing a very nicely contrived apparatus for unwrapping and mending them. Steam is introduced into this case, and by a complicated method the rolls are straightened and deciphered. They are black and charred, the writing showing on their black surfaces. This "library" belonged to a private gentleman of <placeName ref="#Herculaneum">Herculaneum</placeName>, and consisted of about 3000 volumes or rolls - many of which have been deciphered. How it stirs the imagination to think of the dignified repose of that ancient library, now buried from 50 to 100 feet under the lava that rushed down the sides of <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> on that dreadful night A.D. 79.

A long drive through the busy and picturesque streets and a climb backwards and forwards, on one side looking down upon the varied roofs and terraces and gardens - on the other high walls of masonry or rock, pierced in places with staircases leading to the level above, from the tops of which trees and gardens and houses look down upon you, to the level of which the next turn brings you. This characteristic feature of <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName>, <pb n="122"/> is delightful - and each rise in the road reveals more and more its magnificent entourage of mountains, pictureque coasts and sea - making it the most beautiful city in the world - all this, and the sunny spring-like morning seemed too enchanting to be real. This <placeName ref="#Certosa_di_San_Martino">Carthusian Monastery of S.

I should like to have had hours to spend in these deserted courts and cloisters and halls. It was begun in 1325, and rebuilt in the 17th century.

        <p>This morning opened dismally enough with heavy clouds, and very high wind. All our arrangements made yesterday by telegram for coming here had to be changed. We proposed driving to <!--Not sure what this place is--><placeName>Pajano</placeName>, and there taking a boat to <placeName ref="#Amalfi">Amalfi</placeName> - this would have been delightful - but the water was out of question in such a gale as this. So again everything had to be countermanded - and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> pointed out to me with renewed vigour, how foolish it was to spend more time on this <placeName ref="#Amalfi">Amalfi</placeName> project. But I fought stoutly for it, as I was very averse to leave this part of <placeName ref="#Italy">Italy</placeName> for the third time without a visit here, to <placeName ref="#Paestum">Paestum</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Ravello">Ravello</placeName>. As it was necessary to drive back to <placeName ref="#Castelamore">Castelamare</placeName>, and thence to <placeName ref="#Cava_de_Tirreni">La Cava</placeName>, and from there here, as we could no longer consider one other route we came to a compromise, and I said, if on reaching <placeName ref="#Castelamore">Castelamare</placeName> it should rain, I would give up the whole scheme, and we would take the train back to <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName>. So we packed into a big carriage with three good horses, and started. The very moment I thought the rain would begin. As we clattered over the stony streets of <placeName ref="#Castelamore">Castelemare</placeName>, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> looked at me as if he thought I might relent, and said, "Is it to be <placeName ref="#Cava_de_Tirreni">La Cava</placeName>", and I said "yes", and we all laughed, and the order <pb n="125"/> was given. The clouds hung low about <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> and the wind almost tore our hats off our heads; but we held on our way, and soon the interest of the scene began to enthral us, and we became more and more charmed. We were driving through the country south of <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName>, and drawing near the mountains - the rugged heights crowned with ruined towns of castle and monastery - the plain richly cultivated - <placeName ref="#Pompeii">Pompeii</placeName> lay between us and <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> - we passed through <placeName ref="#Pagani">Pagani</placeName>, a large town of 15,000 inhabitants, with industries, and very prosperous. The approach to <placeName ref="#Cava_de_Tirreni">La Cava</placeName> was beautiful. It is a picturesque town lying in a valley - a favorite resort for the Neapolitans in the summer and autumn. We stopped for luncheon, and to rest the horses, at a charming little hotel of excellent reputation, the <name type="hotel" ref="#Albergo_di_Loudra">Albergo di Loudra"</name>, and were delighted with it. In the dining room hung large prints of Bryant and Longfellow. But the beauty of the town was only seen on leaving it. A long street of arcades leads through it to a wild and romantic valley, very narrow, on one side of which runs the railway from <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Salerno">Salerno</placeName> over a fine viaduct. Every turn of the splendid road revealed some new beauty - before, behind us, and on each side. The steep hillsides and cliffs were actually yellow with cowslips - and everywhere the grass was drifted over with daisies, like a fall of snow - sweet purple violets nodded their heads amongst them, and purple anemones fringed the banks and walls. We passed the town of <placeName ref="#Vietri">Vietri</placeName>, lying high above us, and turning to the right, leaving the road to <placeName ref="#Salerno">Salerno</placeName>, we soon had an excellent view of the beautiful bay of <placeName ref="#Salerno">Salerno</placeName>, with its town at the waters edge, far below us. Then the magnificent road began to ascend <pb n="126"/> and in spite of clouds, giving us superb views of the encircling mountains, the sun here and there striking their summits and sides with a shaft of light sent through the heavy clouds above them. The most enchanting villages in the valleys - and clinging to the hillsides - with their picturesque diversity of roofs, outside stair cases and arches, and terraced gardens. Lemon trees occupied every square inch of these, from the waters edge almost to the top of the cliffs. The sea, far far below us, was dashing against the rocks, throwing up clouds of spray , and farther out, the white crested waves were chasing each other in. As we drove along the headlands, the wind seemed as if it would lift the carriage, and dash it against the rocks. The descent was beautiful and inspiriting, with all that wild accompaniment of wind and black cloud. At regular intervals along the coast began to appear strange square watch towers, built I believe, by <persName ref="#Charles_V_Emperor">Charles Vth</persName> for protection against pirates. When almost within sight of <placeName ref="#Amalfi">Amalfi</placeName> the rain began and poured in torrents with thunder and lightning. The carriage was hastily closed, and waterproofs donned. Our arrival was very funny. We were stopped down on the little quay for 20 minutes, because there was a boat hauled across the street! Many dozen stout arms however, soon got it out of the way, and we proceeded a little farther under dark arches and vaulted streets, where every inch of room seemed to be occupied by boats, which had been pulled up out of reach of the furious surf. To our consternation the carriage stopped at the base of the cliff, and a polite hotel clerk with courteous manners came to meet us, and said in broken English that we must take <pb n="127"/> "only a little walk of perhaps five minutes to the hotel"! We looked up as well as the rain would allow us, to a vanishing vista of stone steps, and courageously shouldered our umbrellas, and set out upon our pilgrimage up to the <!--Cant determine what this place is--><placeName>Albergo dei Cappucini</placeName>, a suppressed monastery of olden times, built half in the face of the cliff, and now metamorphosed into an hotel. As we climbed up the 250 steps, we paused once in a while to get our breaths, and look out upon glimpses of the wide prospect - and when we arrived at the entrance, and were shown into a long low vaulted corridor, as white as white wash could make it, with unmistakeable English luggage, interspersed with bath tubs, and peeped into the really pretty and comfortable little bedrooms, which used to be the barren cells of the monks, we felt quite repaid for our trouble. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> was put into one of these little cells, each one of which had a bit of enclosed balcony in front of it, making it a kind of tiny sitting room. They were furnished with little brass beds, white toilet tables and pretty chintz, and were really rather attractive. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I were taken through a devious narrow corridor, and came out upon a broad stone staircase leading down into a great hall, where the <!--Table d'hôte is a menu-->table d'hôte stood ready for dinner, and beyond, we were shown into the prettiest of airy, comfortable sitting rooms, with a bright little fire burning in one corner, and a double bedded room opening from it with brass beds, chintz, muslin curtains etc. and candles burning on the toilet table. It was such a picture of comfort, with its quaint vaulted roof painted white! The dinner was served in the former refectory, with big crosses on the ceiling - and the drawing room was <pb n="128"/> made out of some of the cells. I have been sitting up in front of the fire for a long time - every one else has long been in bed - and the dash of the heavy surf is in my ears, on the rocks way below me - and I feel something as I imagine an eagle does in its nest!</p>

        <p>The morning was threatening, and we dared not venture upon our excursion to <placeName ref="#Ravello">Ravello</placeName>. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went down the cliff and into the town for a walk, and I went with the proprietor into the strange old chapel, where a snuffy, wheezy priest, the last survivor of the former monks, and so fat that I wondered how he could climb the stairs to this place, was holding a service, with a congregation of a dozen or more. We went into the gallery, and looked down on them, and my companion responded devoutly and sonorously through the service. Then I went out into the small cloister, with its pretty interlacing Moorish colonnade, and beyond to a great cave, with lofty projecting roof, where is a huge crucifix, and the two thieves on their crosses, making a most strange effect. Regular stations lead to it from the town below. Then I went out into the narrow terraces of the garden, which were full of flowers - gay geraniums, nasturtiums, hyacinths, mignonette and other flowers. The bees were busy among them, and the air so sweet with fragrance - but the clouds were so threatening I did not venture to climb to the orange grove above. The landlord told me that the monastery was founded in 1212 by <persName ref="#Capnano_Pietro_Cardinal">Cardinal Pietro Capnano</persName> as a Cistercian convent - but passed in the 14th century into the hands of <pb n="129"/> the Capucins. It was twice suppressed - first under <persName ref="#Murat">Murat</persName>, and again in the late general suppression of Italian monasteries. The views from the garden show <placeName ref="#Amalfi">Amalfi</placeName> nestled in the cliffs, which seem to hang over her, and most of the houses look to be plastered on to the cliffs. The storm began after lunch with redoubled fury, the carriage was countermanded, and sat about the fire, in our queer little sitting room hung high above the rearing surf. Not a bad place in which to spend such an afternoon, but the disappointment of it all! after giving up four of our precious days to see all this coast - and then to find persistent storms and constant rain. And now, we must leave it all unseen, for we cannot wait longer, with no prospect of clearing weather, and must be off for <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> by 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. At dinner last night and then again tonight, <persName ref="#Kidder_Charles_Mr #Kidder_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kidder</persName> of <placeName ref="#Boston">Boston</placeName> sat opposite to us. They say they have been waiting here a week to make the same excursions, we have been hoping to make - and they too are going tomorrow in despair. On the table by me as I write is a large dish of primroses and violets bought in this afternoon by our landlord.</p>

        <p>We got off from <placeName ref="#Amalfi">Amalfi</placeName> this morning. All last night the storm continued - and whenever I awoke the wind was howling and the sea roaring. It was like being at sea - and gave me a pleasant feeling of comfort to be lying in my pretty bedroom, and listen to the wild <pb n="130"/> tumult outside. In the morning when I got up the hail was rattling against the window, and forcing its way under it. For a time we feared it was too bad even for starting away - but the rain ceased fortunately for half an hour, and gave us time to climb down the interminable steps. We found the <persName ref="#Kidder_Charles_Mr #Kidder_Mrs">Kidders</persName> had already started - and we were hardly more than on our way when the rain began gently dropping and it was nothing but putting umbrellas up and down all the rest of the time. Down in the town the scene was very animated, and even exciting. All the inhabitants seemed to be collected in the narrow streets, watching the heavy surf as it plunged over the narrow beach and beat upon the little quay - and trying to put their boats in safe places. We had to make a great run for it in some places, as the waves would occasionally send the water over the road and against the cliff. But soon we were beyond its reach, and climbing over the same magnificent road we passed over two days ago - but alas! there was even less to be seen today - for rain and mists drowned everything. Great blue black clouds hung low upon the mountains - and sometimes we would drive right into them - and the wind howling about us, made it seem very wild and impressive. Our driver did not spare his horses, and to the music of his constant cracking of his whip, an accomplishment dear to the heart of an Italian coachman, and the cheerful caracolling of the irrepressible small boy atop of our luggage behind the carriage, we sped on and were at <placeName ref="#Cava_de_Tirreni">La Cava</placeName> in time for lunch at 11:30. We fell in with the <persName ref="#Kidder_Charles_Mr #Kidder_Mrs">Kidders</persName> again, and were off in the same compartment for <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> by 2:30. I shall always remember the Italian <pb n="131"/> boy aforesaid - handsome as a picture - with his blue black hair, shining teeth, and russett red cheeks - alert and ready - jumping down from his perch again and again to pick a flower by the rodside for me, pattering through the wet in his cold bare feet - then clambering up again like a monkey, and breaking into a song. He was delightful, and I should like to have carried him off with me. I filled my bag at luncheon with a big red apple, with figs, and nuts and biscuit which I gave him as we were driving to the station, along with half a franc, and as <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> had already given him 1 franc, he was a happy fellow, and his smiling face was a pleasant send off. Here we are established for the night in most charming rooms overlooking the quay, over which the tremendous surf is sometimes beating. It is pronounced all along this coast the most remarkable storm ever known. We took <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> to the Aquarium this afternoon - the <persName ref="#Kidder_Charles_Mr #Kidder_Mrs">Kidders</persName> came up and spent the evening, and said goodbye, and now we are all equipped for an early start to <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> in the morning.</p>

        <p>I was happy to be once more in this old city, where we arrived at 3 o'clock. The journey from <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> was delightful - through superb mountain scenery - the railway following very nearly the course of the ancient <!--Should i make tag for this? This is a road--><placeName>Via Appia.</placeName> First, farewell glimpses of Mr. <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Ischia">Ischia,</placeName> and that incomparable coast - then through the plain of the important river <!--How to deal with river tags?--><placeName>Volturno</placeName> with the grand mountains sweeping up from it on either <pb n="132"/> hand in splendid majesty - their heights crowned here and there with supressed monasteries, ruined castles, crumbling towers and walls, with ancient Roman towns nestling along the cliffs and ravines. Then into the great plains of the <placeName ref="#Campania">Campania</placeName>, an enormously fertile district under high cultivation now called the <placeName ref="#Terra_di_Lavoro">Terra di Lavoro</placeName>, then through the valley of the <!--River--><placeName>Garigliano</placeName> - then that of the <!--Cant find--><persName>Jacco,</persName> and at last we were approaching <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> with its <!--Countryside-->Campagnia scenery - the <placeName ref="#Sabine">Sabine</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Alban_Mountains">Alban Mountains</placeName> on our right, with the arches of the <name>Acqua Felice,</name> and <persName>Acqua Marcia</persName> striding along the plain - and the <placeName ref="#Aurunci_Mountains">Volscian Mountains</placeName> with glimpses of the sea on our left.</p>
        <p>If I were a man I should make an expedition through all this country. I would see many of the old towns with their polygonal walls, and old temples and ampitheatres - and I would visit those old monasteries especially that of <placeName ref="#Monte_Cassino">Monte Casino</placeName>, with the <!--Cant find this place--><placeName ref="#Appennin_Abruzzese">Abruggi Mountains</placeName> lying opposite on the east across the narrow plain. This would be fascinating with its chapels and marbles, its carving and its pictures. It was founded by <persName ref="#Benedict_of_Nursia">St. Benedict</persName> in 529 on the site of an ancient <placeName ref="#Temple_of_Apollo">temple of Apollo</placeName>. The priceless library must well be worth a visit. It now contains 10,000 volumes, including many rare additions, and specimens of early printing. Among the numerous and valuable <!--What is this?-->MS preserved in the archives, are the commentary of <persName ref="#Origen_of_Alexandria">Origen</persName> on the epistle to the Romans, dating from the 6th century - splendidly illuminated <!--What is this?-->MSS, documents of kings, popes, etc. bulls, letters etc. There now remain in this convent 30 monks who share the charge of the library and archives, and educate theological students. After taking possession of our rooms, we drove <pb n="133"/> to the bankers for letters, and then over to <placeName ref="#St_Peters">St. Peters</placeName>. <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> is changing fast. Within the two years since we have been here, whole quarters have been destroyed - streets have been made - bridges built - and square after square of handsome new houses. Old <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> indeed threatens to be improved from off the face of the earth. Much is to be said for and against these wholesale changes. There is great gain in the way of health and convenience - many invaluable remains are brought to the light in the necessary excavations - important historical facts verified - and the general appearance of the city will be vastly improved. But very much of the old charm and interesting character is lost. All those rows of picturesque houses dipping their foundations in the flood of the <!--River--><placeName>yellow Tiber</placeName>, which gave such a charm to the banks of the river, are now being decourously tucked away and hidden beyond the solid and handsome stone quays now building on both sides of the river. We all burst into a howl of indignation however, when we came to the <placeName ref="#Ponte_Sant_Angelo">Ponte S. Angelo</placeName>, to see a modern iron suspension bridge thrusting itself within a stones toss of the <!--verify later--><placeName ref="#Castel_Sant_Angelo">S. Angelo</placeName>! and it is said a bridge of the same kind is to be thrown across the Forum! What a sense of satisfied delight one feels, when the heavy curtain of <!--What is this?--><placeName>S. Pietro</placeName> falls behind one, and one confronts all the colossal magnificence of this unequalled church! Far away in the vast expanse rises the great bronze baldachine, with its circle of twinkling lights before it, and pigmies of human beings come and go, and arrange themselves in groups over that vast tesselated pavement - and a low muffled reverberation characteristic of the place, compounded of shuffling footsteps and distant <pb n="134"/> chanting, and outside roar and turmoil, makes itself felt rather than heard. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> walked about in a maze of delight. It is such a charm to find myself again in <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> - every sight of the streets is dear to me.</p>

        <p>We took <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> this morning for her first visit to the <orgName ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Uffizi</orgName>. In consideration of my lameness, we committed ourselves to the elevator, and paid a franc apiece for the transit to those lofty galleries - and a dangerous one it seemed, worked with an ordinary rope cable, and bumping and knocking from side to side, and making the strangest noises. When we came away, I preferred to climb down those stony staircases, rather than trust myself to it again. We spent two and a half hours in these incomparable galleries, before we emerged more dead than alive. In the afternoon we drove to <placeName ref="#San_Miniato">S. Miniato</placeName>, which always delights me. I like to sit down on the parapet at the edge of the terrace, and look at the church, rich and lovely, with its inlaid marbles tones and yellowed by age. It is of the Pisan Florentine style, not unlike <placeName ref="#Saint_Maria_Novella">S. Maria Novella</placeName>, and the hideous and fantastic Italian cemetery which surrounds it cannot detract from its charm. Next to it, and apparently part of it is the old machicolated <placeName ref="#Palazzo_Mozzi">Mozzi Palace</placeName>.  <placeName ref="#San_Miniato">S. Miniato</placeName> is one of my favorite spots in <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName>, and when I am tired of looking at the church I can turn and look at the fortifications built by <persName ref="#Michelangelo">Michael Angelo,</persName> through the gateway of which we approach the church - and to the noble <pb n="140"/> view of the lovely city, spread out far below us - the <!--River--><placeName>Arno</placeName> glistening in silver curves away in the distance, and, surrounded by that grand sweep of hills and mountains, <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName>, with the great <placeName ref="#Brunelleschi_dome">dome of Brunelleschi,</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Giotto_Campanile">Giotto's Tower</placeName>, and the more graceful campanile of the <placeName ref="#Palazzo_Vecchio">Palazzo Vecchio</placeName>, towering over the other domes and lesser campaniles and stately palaces and picturesque bridges. Its beauty is all its own, - and it looks so small - even in glorious days when , intellectually and artistically, it ruled the world, and of the fierce dissensions and cruel wars and brutal turmoils, that surged about within its very walls for centuries - of which the great palaces, more like fortifications than palaces, are now the only witnesses.</p>
        <p>The cemetery here at <placeName ref="#San_Miniato">S. Miniato</placeName> seems to overflow into the church, and little railings and photographs and artificial flowers and mimic trees surround the tomb stones here as well as outside, and make a kind of <placeName ref="#Camposanto_Monumentale_di_Pisa">Campo Santo</placeName> of the whole place. The interior arrangement is peculiar - and the pavement and marble work of the choir, is of the 13th century and very beautiful and curious. From <placeName ref="#San_Miniato">S. Miniato</placeName> we drove to <placeName ref="#Santa_Croce">S. Croce</placeName>, where a service was going on, with some solemn and delicious music - the church in a half twilight, with the twinkling lights of the altars, with its simple and noble proportions, was more impressive than I have ever seen it - and the tombs of <placeName ref="#Italy">Italy</placeName>'s mighty dead - <persName ref="#Alighieri_Dante ">Dante</persName>, <persName ref="#Michelangelo">Michael Angelo</persName>, <persName ref="#Galilei_Galileo">Galileo</persName> etc. smite one with feelings of awe.

Then we went to <placeName ref="#San_Marco">S. Marco</placeName>, to the cloisters and monastery and home in time for lunch.

I went to some shops, and to the interesting chruch of Or <persName ref="#Michael">San Michele</persName> - a little service was going on, and I sat down on one of the empty benches, and read my book, and examined the details of the wonderful shrine of <persName ref="#Orcagna">Orcagna</persName>, built for <persName ref="#Ugolino">Ugolino</persName>'s sacred picture of the miraculous <!--what is this-->Madonna, in 1359. The picture was veiled of course, this being <name type="event" ref="#Holy_Week">Holy Week</name>, so that I could not see it - but I walked all around the shrine, in spite of the service going on in the chancel close by - one grows so soon accustomed to these things in Italy. The windows of this church are exquisite in tracery and stained glass. I had myself driven twice about the church, in order to see the admirable statues with which it is adorned - among which <persName ref="#Donatello">Donatello</persName>'s famous <objectName ref="#St_George">St. George</objectName> is the finest - a noble and lovely thing.

        <p>The days have flown by - the weather bad - dark and raining most of the time. It is pleasant to be in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName> once more - in spite of smoke and fog, and too, too frequent rain, it is charming. <persName ref="#Rathbone_Mr">Mr. Rathbone</persName> <pb n="147"/> called on Thursday - and Friday morning we met him at <orgName ref="#Agnews_Gallery">Agnews</orgName>, where we had gone to see the strange and beautiful drawings of the <bibl><title>"Legend of the Briar Rose"</title> by <author><persName ref="#Burne_Jones">Burne Jones</persName></author></bibl> - in a series of four pictures. The rooms were beautifully trimmed with flowers - it was the first morning of the exhibition, and if we had waited until the afternoon, we would have seen a lot of notable people, <persName ref="#Gladstone_William">Mr. Gladstone</persName> among others.</p>
        <p>On Friday, we went to <orgName ref="#Mintons">Minton</orgName>'s and chose some beautiful new china. On Saturday morning <persName ref="#Farrer_Gaspard">Mr Gaspard Farrar</persName> called, and asked <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> to dinner, where he is this evening. Then we walked around to <placeName ref="#Vigo_Street">Vigo Street</placeName> to the two little silver shops, and at one of them <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought some charming old silver platters and trays. Then to <orgName ref="#Dunthorans_Gallery">Dunthoran's gallery</orgName>, where in his pretty rooms we saw a lot of beautiful etchings by <persName ref="#Strange_William">William Strange</persName> - one of which <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought. Here the sun which had been fitfully shining, disappeared - and a yellow fog, which afterwards became black rapidly fell upon us - and in a few moments it was too dark to see to read on the street. There was nothing for it but to get into a four wheeler, detestable things, and come home, and wait for better things, which didn"t come - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I stayed in doors the rest of the day. There were the strange lurid, ominous effects so often seen in the <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName> atmosphere, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> seemed to think it a special show got up for her amusement.

        <p>"Here lyeth the loyall <persName ref="#Newcastle_Duke_of">Duke of Newcastle</persName> and his <persName ref="#Newcastle_Duchess_of">Dutchess</persName>, who was "his second wife, and bywhom he had no issue, her name was <persName ref="#Newcastle_Duchess_of">Margaret Lucas</persName>, youngest sister to the <persName ref="#Lucas_Lord">Lord Lucas</persName> of <placeName ref="#Calchester">Calchester</placeName>, a noble familie, "of which all the Brothers were valiant, and all the sisters virtuous.

        <p>Soon after getting home, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> came in with <persName ref="#Milliken_David">Mr. Milliken</persName> and telling them about the service, I repeated the epitaph. <persName ref="#Milliken_David">Mr. Milliken</persName> then told me of a tombstone he had seen in <placeName ref="#Indiana">Indiana</placeName>, with this inscription.</p>

        <p>A week ago since I found time to write in my journal, during which week time has been racing along, and we have been vainly trying to keep up with it.

We spent a delightful morning at the <placeName ref="#Westminster_Abbey">Abbey</placeName>, saw a spring flower show, went to the "first view" of the <orgName ref="#Academy">Academy</orgName>, for which we had tickets sent us through the kindness of friends.

We spent one afternoon at the <orgName ref="#British_Museum">British Museum</orgName>, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> taking down his <name type="plant" ref="#papyrus">papyrus</name> for repairs and translation, and having the courage to send his sphynx afterwards to the <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> department for examination as to its age and genuinness. We looked through the <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> things with great interest. Yesterday we left <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName> for this place, having arranged with <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">Mr L&#252;ling</persName> an undergraduate here about our visit.

        <p><pb n="150"/> Sunday evening. A charming day is done. The weather has been delightful. We began the day by walking at half past 10 o'clock with <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">Mr. L&#252;ling</persName> through the "Backs" as the meadows lying back of the colleges are called. The freshness of the young foliage - the flowers - the birds - all made a picture of spring beauty - we walked through <orgName ref="#Kings_College">Kings</orgName>, <orgName ref="#Trinity_College">Trinity</orgName>, <orgName ref="#Clare_College">Clare College</orgName>s, and went to <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">Mr. L&#252;ling</persName>'s rooms for lunch, where we met a friend of his, <persName ref="#Feilding_Mr">Mr. Fielding</persName> a younger son of the <persName ref="#Feilding_Rudolph_Lord">Earl of Denhigh</persName>. A most delightful young fellow. Then I went home for a rest, while the rest went for service at <name type="historical" ref="#Kings_Chapel">King's Chapel</name>. I was sorry not to see this - but I had a splitting headache. At 4 o'clock <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Austin_Constance">Constance Austin</persName> went to <persName ref="#Darwin_George_Mrs">Mrs. George Darwin</persName>'s, a friend of <persName ref="#Austin_Constance">Constance</persName>'s, for afternoon tea, and <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">Mr. L&#252;ling</persName> came to take me and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> to <persName ref="#Feilding_Mr">Mr. Fielding</persName>s rooms in <orgName ref="#Trinity_College">Trinity College</orgName>, where we were to have tea - pleasant rooms, and simple unaffected fellows. The <persName ref="#Feilding_Mr">Mr. Fielding</persName>s who had secured places for us in the <name type="historical" ref="#Trinity_Chapel">Chapel</name> for afternoon service, walked across the Quad with us - without anything on his head. He and <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">L&#252;ling</persName>, who is a member of <orgName ref="#Trinity_College">Trinity Hall</orgName>, and both <orgName ref="#Roman_Catholics">Roman Catholics</orgName>, did not attend chapel, but on coming out <persName ref="#Feilding_Mr">Mr. F</persName>. came down from the organ gallery with the organist, where he had been during the service - he is very musical. We had a lovely service, and the famous great organ - and all the men coming in in their white gowns, looked as if they might be a congregation of angels. Then after a stroll through the gardens and meadows in the sweet evening light, the young men walked back to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Bull_Hotel">Bull</name> with us, <persName ref="#Feilding_Mr">Mr. F</persName>. without his hat or gown, and we were hoping to see a proctor light upon him. Then we all went to <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">L&#252;ling</persName>'s rooms for high tea, and spent <pb n="151"/> a nice good evening in pleasant talk. The young men walked back to the hotel with us, and we declared when they had said goodbye, that we have never seen two such nice boys.</p>

We found <persName ref="#Davis_Anne">Mrs. Davis</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Sara">Miss Buttles</persName> here - the former looking very ill - and now <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I am sitting in a dismal heavy sitting room, feeing that the fair is over, and prosaic things now await us.</p>

        <p>Just a week ago, we left <placeName ref="#Southampton">Southampton</placeName>, and we should have been in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> by this time, had we not met with so much fog. For two days and nights the fog whistle has been going most of the time, making sleep at night almost impossible. The voyage has been quiet and uneventful. We have had one hard blow. The big ship <measure quantity="460" unit="feet">460 feet</measure> long is, next to the City of <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName>, the fastest on the ocean. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I have a big room, with wardrobe, with mirrored door - table - lounge etc. but in spite of the comforts and luxuries, I have never felt more wretched on the <placeName ref="#Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</placeName>. There has not been much motion, but what there was, was all in the way of pitching - rising and falling - the most trying of all motions. The voyage has seemed interminable. One day we saw 3 icebergs - and if the course had been the usual one, no doubt we would have been in the midst of icebergs. But on the last voyage to <placeName ref="#Southampton">Southampton</placeName>, such an extent of field ice, <pb n="153"/> and so many ice bergs were passed, that, on the voyage the Captain took a very southerly course. Our progress has been as follows:</p>
        <!-- This part is a table - please see: https://bit.ly/3ubBRJf -->
        <p>First day (21-&#189; hours <measure quantity="418" unit="mile">418 miles</measure>. <lb/>2d " <measure quantity="461" unit="mile">461</measure> " <lb/>3d "	<measure quantity="459" unit="mile">459</measure> " <lb/>4th " (heavy gales) <measure quantity="439" unit="mile">439</measure> " <lb/>5th " (fog) <measure quantity="442" unit="mile">442</measure> " <lb/>6th " " <measure quantity="470" unit="mile">470</measure> "</p>
        <p>We were still in a dense fog and reported to be <measure quantity="40" unit="mile">40 miles</measure> from <placeName ref="#Sandy_Hook">Sandy Hook</placeName> (10 o'clock A.M.). We have not yet found a pilot, and are scarcely moving through the thick fog - sounding our whistle every moment. Should this fog lift, we would easily be in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> by noon - allowing for quarantine etc. but as we will surely be in today, I now close this little record of the winter's travel, feeling assured that the pleasure of future reference to it, will more than atone for all the time I have given to it.</p>
