                <p>Dear <persName ref="#Adeline">Adeline</persName> <!--need to figure out last name of Adeline and Augustus, friends of MBN from New Haven-->:- There is such a wild wind from the desert tonight that the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> is rocking as she never did during the entire voyage up from <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. Always immediately after dinner I come into my room and hang out of my window for a few minutes to look at the stars and the lights of <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> Tonight they are veiled in sand. The wind rose in the afternoon. It was calm enough when <persName>Doris</persName> and I went to church this morning. Upon emerging from the sanctuary I had a little talk with <persName ref="#Hutchins_Waldo #Hutchins_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Hutchins</persName>, <persName ref="#Porter_Delia">Delia Porter</persName>'s relatives who are birds of passage through <pb n="29"/> <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> We brought <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss Buchanan</persName> home to luncheon. She it is who built up the <orgName ref="#American_Mission_School">Mission School</orgName> (the <orgName ref="#American-Mission-School">American Mission</orgName>) at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>, and who is head now of the larger one in <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, and whom <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Cousin Theodore</persName> admires so profoundly. Everyone does, I think. A little, very plain little woman, whose "outward semblance doth belie her soul's immensity". The beauty of that soul makes itself apparent to all kinds of people. A <persName ref="#Sheik">Sheik</persName> from the desert who came to one of the <name type="event" ref="Commencement">Commencements</name> at the <orgName ref="#American_Mission_School">Mission School</orgName> here said to one of the teachers, in speaking of <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss Buchanan</persName>, "Today for the first time in my life have I seen a Woman!How can I go back to those three - my wives!"</p>
                 <p>This afternoon the <persName ref="#Fahnestock_Gibson #Fahnestock_Mrs">Fahnestocks</persName> came to tea and some <orgName ref="#English">English</orgName> people named <persName ref="#Rae_group">Rae</persName> puffed over in a steam Launch from <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> bringing <persName ref="#Mohassib_Mohammed">Mohammed Mohassib</persName>. The old man enjoyed himself enormously, sat in various chairs, chuckling at everything, insisted on drinking tea, because it was the custom at this hour on this boat, though he disliked it greatly, and we were all telling him to wait a few minutes and he should have some coffee. We were disappointed because he wasn't clad in rich raiment - he being a millionaire - but he was bundled up in a brown and white checked shawl around his neck and an old brown overcoat with a hood to it, such as our sailors wear at night.</p>

                 <p>A heavenly day - like all the others that have gone before it. The wind ceased suddenly last night before it had tom us from our moorings, and this morning dawned as quietly as possible. <persName>Doris</persName> went over to <placeName>Karnak</placeName> for the forenoon with <persName>Margaret Fahnestock,</persName> and in the afternoon she rode out to the diggings with <persName>Cousin Theodore,</persName> while I spent the afternoon in the novel and thrilling occupation of falling in love with a <orgName>Russian</orgName> Princess. The <persName>Contessa</persName> had invited me to go to <placeName>Karnak</placeName> in a small party of which the Princess was one. We were to be shown about by <persName>M. Legrain</persName> himself (he has for years been conducting the excavations at <placeName>Karnak).</placeName> But that part fell through and it was Mme. <persName>Legrain</persName> who took us about, <persName>Legrain</persName> himself being absorbed with a dissipated looking Prince <persName>de Croix.</persName> But little I cared as long as I could gaze upon my Princess. Besides, I think we saw pretty much what we would have seen under <orgName>Legrain's</orgName> guidance.</p>
                 <p>We watched the workmen carefully unearthing a large and beautiful jar from a ruined and crumbling wall beyond the sacred lake. We held our breaths while it was being emptied, and let them out again when nothing but a brick was found inside. We went to the little temple of <placeName>Ptah</placeName> in one dusky room of which stands the uncanny black granite statue of <persName>Sekmet,</persName> the goddess with the lion's head. When you have looked at her for five minutes she becomes so vibrant with life that it is easy to understand why the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> believe that she sometimes prowls forth seeking whom she may devour. My chief pleasure this afternoon was watching the Princess -a fairy Princess, young, little, beautiful, quiet, with a delightful laugh and a perfect simplicity of manner. She looks like a high bred <orgName>Englishwoman</orgName> except that her eyes are somehow different. Her skin is healthily tanned with a lively color in it. She wore a most perfect pongee skirt, just off the white in tone, shoes to match, a short silk sweater coat of tawny orange, a hat like all our hats (bought in <placeName>Cairo</placeName> for $1. 00) with a long veil, like all our veils only of a lighter shade than her sweater, a cane with a bloodstone sunk in the top of the handle, and a monocle on a black ribbon. She walked so well on her little feet and when she took off her gloves later at tea in the garden of the <placeName>Luxor Hotel,</placeName> her hands were covered with superb sapphires. <persName>Doris</persName> had seen her on the street in the morning, was insantly antagonized by the monocle, and came home saying she was "a sight" and that her donkey had shied at her. So much for the intolerance of youth. She is the Princess <persName>Gortschokoff</persName> and she has me bound to her chariot wheels. </p>

                    <date when="1913-02-04">Tuesday, February 4.</date>
                </dateline>
                  <p><persName>Doris</persName> and I have had a perfect day. <persName>Harry</persName> elected to spend the holiday in the valley and invited <persName>Doris</persName> and me to come out to see the tomb of <placeName>Horemheb,</placeName> which neither of us had entered, and also that I might see the <orgName>Siphtah</orgName> sarcophagus, and then to lunch with him at the House. We got up early and had breakfast at eight (nine is the usual hour) and were off on our donkeys before the <persName>Cousins</persName> appeared. We rode via the landing place opposite <placeName>Luxor</placeName> and it was a sight worth seeing. Two steamers had come in last night and scores upon scores of people were bound for the valley and the hubbub and the color and the excitement! Scores and scores of donkeys with their gay trappings, scores and scores of donkey boys in blue and white and a dash of red on their chests, native policemen in <orgName>khaki</orgName> trying to keep order while their splendid camels lay waiting for them in the background - carriages, sand carts - and everybody shouting and talking at once. It was immensely amusing. I did enjoy my ride, and the light and the color on the <orgName>Libyan Range</orgName> were of surpassing beauty, but so blinding that we had to lower our chiffon veils.</p> 
                  <p>We rode first to the <persName>House,</persName> to drop our donkeys and pick up <persName>Harry,</persName> and then we walked around to the Valley of the Tombs. We went first into <persName>Horemheb</persName> which is not a very easy tomb to enter, as the once kingly flights of steps leading down into it are not but crumbling masonry. But what beauty of painted walls when once you have made the descent, and what a superb sarcophagus! More interesting to me than the completed work were the walls where the designs were sketched in merely, looking as though the artist had just laid down his crayon and his brushes and gone home to luncheon. <placeName>Horemheb</placeName> is lighted by electricity - but <persName>Siphtah</persName> more appropriately by reflected sunlight from a large mirror at the mouth. The chief interest in <placeName>Siphtah</placeName> is the sarcophagus. <persName>They've</persName> not got the lid turned over yet, but the thing is very impressive from its size. The inscriptions on it seemed to me to be done in rather an archaic manner, but <persName>Harry</persName> is of the opinion that that is because red granite is such a difficult medium.</p> 
                  <p>It was horribly hot walking back to the <name>House</name> in the fierce light of noon, but it's the sort of heat one can stand if one's head and the back of one's neck are covered. We had a very gay luncheon with <persName>Harry</persName> and Mr. <persName>Launcelot Crane,</persName> and a lovely ride home. As we passed <persName>Howard Carter's</persName> diggings we were surprised to see that he was working his full force of 300 in spite of its being the holiday. He was probably doing it under orders from <placeName>Lord Carnarvon.</placeName> That rather damaged nobleman was standing under an awning arrangement, leaning on his cane, surveying the proceedings. When we reached the <orgName>Beduin the Contessa</orgName> was here and eight other people came soon after. Two of them were the <persName>Masperos</persName> to say good-bye, as they start down the river in the morning. Sir <persName>Gaston</persName> tells me that my Princess is the granddaughter of the old and famous <persName>Prince Gortschokoff;</persName> that she is married to a commoner by whose name she is never called! My mind is absorbed tonight between my passion for my Princess and my interest in the strange habits of camels. I passed one on the road this afternoon, which hated me instantly, and in order apparently to express its utter loathing it threw up one of its stomachs and swallowed it again with the most perfectly horrid noise I ever heard.</p>

                  <p>and Ash Wednesday too. I didn't go to church, but it was a self-denial not to, so I hope it's all right.

                  <p>Dearest Adeline:- This letter ought really to be skipped and all of you may skip it without hurting my feelings in the very least. Since my last, the <name>Land of Egypt</name> has been the <name>House of Bondage</name> to me - the past week having been an unpleasant medley of broken engagements, frustrated plans, homesickness and sciatica. At least I suppose sciatica is the gentle distemper that makes one's left leg feel as though it had been skinned alive and all the muscles torn out slowly with hot forceps. I've managed not to stay in bed and I've also managed to play dominoes, but I've not been up to anything else, and in my off hours have shut myself up in my room, swathed in knitted things and packed with hot water bags, and saying "Hame, hame, fain wad I be, <persName>Hame,</persName> hame in my ain countree." To cap the climax we are actually having bad weather. It is now three days since the sunshine has been wholly withdrawn and day before yesterday it actually rained all day; fortunately only a gentle sprinkle - had it been a good <placeName>New Haven</placeName> downpour the mud village opposite us would have dissolved before our eyes.</p> 
                  <p>On Monday I was to have gone on a picnic to the <placeName>Valley of the Queens</placeName> with the <name>Contessa</name> and <persName>Mrs. Pier,</persName> but <persName>Doris</persName> went in my place. On Tuesday I was to have teaed with Mrs. <persName>Daniel Eaton,</persName> way up the river on the <placeName>Arabia,</placeName> but had to send a note saying I was too crippled to come.

                  <p>The other day <persName>Doris</persName> rode with <persName>Dorothy Richardson</persName> over to the abode near <placeName>Der-el-Bahri</placeName> which is called indifferently "the <placeName>American House.</placeName> or <placeName>"Mr. Morgan's House"</placeName>, and in which live the men who are managing the <placeName>Metropolitan</placeName> excavations, and the wives of said men. When the girls got there at ten o'clock the people were just about to have breakfast! As digging stops at four-thirty they must have a short day at the <placeName>Metropolitan Concession.</placeName> Mr. <persName>Morgan's</persName> eccentric behavior has caused a buzz of comment and conjecture. During the two or three days his dahabya lay here the people at the <placeName>American House.</placeName> spent their time in moving into tents and back again according to messages from the <orgName>Great Man</orgName> as to whether he was or was not going out there to occupy. He finally did not go. He had a party often on his boat whom he had invited to go to <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> and somehow it leaked out that their lives were a burden to them because their host was so cross and tyrannical. The <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> plan was suddenly abandoned and they merely tore up to <placeName>Aswan</placeName> and back again, being gone only four days. Then Mr. <persName>Morgan</persName> engaged suites of rooms at the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> for his party and before they had time to move into them he whisked them all down to {31}</p>

                  <p>Dearest Adeline:- Today we could once more say joyfully, with the fire-worshippers, "Lo! the <persName>Lord Sun!"</persName> And if we had been without it for a month we could hardly have welcomed it more gladly. <placeName>Egypt</placeName> would be an intolerable land if it were often gloomy weather.

She stayed a long time, and after <persName>Cousin Theodore</persName> and <persName>Doris</persName> had gone for their ride, she held <persName>Cousin Emma</persName> and me enthralled, as the three of us sat in the sunshine on deck, with the story of her first husband's experiences and death in <placeName>Central Africa,</placeName> whither he went with <persName>Stanley.</persName> When she had finished I felt literally tired from my emotions. It was like a <persName>Henry Seton</persName> novel for interest and quite ghastly and heart-rending. When I come home I'll tell the story to anyone who wants to hear it, but I do not want to write it. The one time I laughed this afternoon was at a scene on the bank. The black dog and the yellow dog, who have constituted themselves guardians of the <orgName>Beduin</orgName> for the sake of the food they get, started to fight and were stopped by the turkey cock who, with all his feathers spread and gobbling furiously, rustled in between them. It was really one of the funniest things I ever saw.</p>

The lid is something unknown in the history of <objectName type="historical" ref="#sarcophagus">sarcophagi</objectName>.

                  <p>The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the <name>Contessa</name> and grateful warmth. The <persName>Contessa</persName> invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> garden. It must be 15 or 20 degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the sun to annihilate my aches. The <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the <name>Contessa</name> chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. <persName>Morgan's</persName> departure without even a look at things that had been saved for him for weeks. It was at <placeName>Hassan's</placeName> at the end of our rounds, that I saw the only things I really wanted. It's surprising how ephemeral many of one's desires prove themselves if one refrains from plunging into buying the moment one gets to a strange place. Dozens of things I thought fascinating when I first began to look about the shops, I now pass with averted gaze because they tire me so. But <persName>Hassan</persName> brought out ten little alabaster jars (tumbler shaped) with a cartouche sunk in the side of each and colored blue, and an alabaster cover to each the size and shape of a large cream peppermint, and I coveted them with my whole heart. But the price of even one of the darling things was too much for me. <persName>Hassan's</persName> shop is quite a mansion with all his treasures on the second floor. You mount a flight of stone stairs which would be imposing if it were not for the traces of many chickens, and while you are poking about among the antiques a tiny page in red and white brings you coffee, of the best, in dainty cups. I brought the <name>Contessa</name> home with me for tea.</p>

                  <p>we again passed the patriotic display of bunting that adorable <persName>Eleanor Pier,</persName> aged seven, said "Whose birthday is this? Did you say it was President <persName>Taft's?"</p>
                  <p></persName> The <persName>Dodges</persName> joined me at the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> and we had tea on the rear terrace, and it was awfully nice to be with friends from my native state. <persName>Doris</persName> and <persName>Janet Dodge</persName> had spent the whole morning together at <placeName>Karnak,</placeName> so <persName>Doris</persName> thought she would better ride to the diggings with <persName>Cousin T.</persName> instead of coming to tea.</p>
                  <p>Now I'm going to wind up with two nice, appropriate little tales. Two or three years ago when on the 22nd of February the <orgName>Beduin</orgName> was in her gala dress to do honor to the day, the Duke and Duchess of <placeName>Connaught,</placeName> coming down the river from <placeName>Aswan,</placeName> thought it was in their honor, and did everything except fire a salute to express their appreciation of the attention! And once in the days when my relatives had that superb dragoman <persName>Mohammed Sala</persName> (that was before <persName>Jones</persName> had qualified as a dragoman) he was much offended that he had not been informed the day beforehand that this important anniversary was pending. Hearing someone say at the breakfast table "This is <persName>Washington's</persName> Birthday - the boat must be dressed", he hurried out. Returning he said to <persName>Cousin Emma "Madam,</persName> the cook say it is not possible to prepare a fitting luncheon for the day without some notice." "I didn't want a special luncheon - the cook gives us too much to eat always, as it is", said <persName>Madam.</persName> At the close of luncheon, entered <persName>Mohammed Sala,</persName> bearing a colossal cake with the <orgName>American</orgName> flag in colored frosting on it. He placed it on the table and with a look of deep reproach at <persName>Cousin Emma,</persName> he announced "Le gateau pour Mr. Washington!" I had the pleasure of seeing <persName>Mohammed Sala</persName> today. On getting into the felucca after leaving the <orgName>Winter Palace,</orgName> the men held it while beckoning and calling to someone on the neighboring boat. Then <persName>Sala</persName> came hurrying along the bank, stepped into the felucca and bowed low over my hand. He said he was here "with one prince". After an exchange of compliments he departed. He is usually with important people. He was twice with the Empress of <persName>Austria,</persName> and she nearly killed him walking out to the <placeName>Pyramids</placeName> from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and back every morning before breakfast. Goodnight, dears all, Your devoted <persName>Mary</persName></p>

                  <p>Dearest Adeline:- <persName>The Contessa</persName> and I had planned to go on a picnic a deux to <placeName>the tombs of the Nobles</placeName> today, but at breakfast time a boat brought a note saying a heavy cold on her chest prevented her going. As I had on my hateful riding things (never donned except for my donkey) I decided to take a ride anyway. Neither <persName>Doris</persName> nor <persName>Cousin Theodore</persName> would go with me, so I went alone, quite thrilled because it was the first time in fifteen days that I had ridden. It was the dullest ride I ever had. <name>Wadi Haifa</name> needed the inspiration of others of his kind. We started off with <persName>Malimond</persName> tugging at his head and a sailor pushing from behind. Shouts, cluckings, gurglings had no effect whatever on him. Whacks simply made his hindquarters go suddenly sideways in the disconcerting movement that almost unseats me. It took me an hour to get out to the <placeName>Colossi,</placeName> so there I turned about, relinquishing the <placeName>Valley of the Queens</placeName> for which I was headed and which I've not yet seen. If <persName>Malimond</persName> and the sailor had even talked to each other it would have been less depressing. I kept getting sadder and sadder and <placeName>Egypt</placeName> began to seem to me a lonely land of <persName>Doom,</persName> when I was suddenly cheered by the sight of a camel loaded with trunks and making for the <placeName>American House.</placeName> A camel can always pluck me out of melancholy. It was very hot coming home and I had to keep my veil down to prevent breathing tiny black flies. {34}</p>

                  <p>This afternoon <persName>Cousin Emma</persName> and I, in response to the <persName>Contessa's</persName> importunities, went over and teaed with her in the <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> gardens. She was very hoarse and the ground was very damp, but the sunshine lovely, the tea delicious and there were three other guests, quite charming - <persName>Lady Baring</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Murray</persName> and the Countess <persName>Pauline Pappenheim.</persName> I talked to the latter all the time, and I'm thankful I don't fall in love with men as easily as I do with women. The <persName>Countess Pauline</persName> is a girl after my own heart - about <persName>Doris's</persName> age, I should think, and with a very noble sort of beauty, and too sweet. She told me she was half <orgName>American</orgName> - that her mother was a <orgName>Philadelphian,</orgName> but I don't know who. And all this time I've been skipping yesterday which may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
                  <p>The boisterous Mr. <persName>Whymper</persName> came to breakfast. <persName>(I've</persName> decided all that excitable volubility is his company manner, because when he crosses over with <persName>Doris</persName> and me in the felucca on our way to church he is quite pleasantly quiet, and his face in repose is sad.) I went to church and after service had a little talk with Mrs. <persName>Daniel Eaton</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Van Winkle</persName> for whom I waited outside 'the door. Brought Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Pier</persName> home with me for luncheon. They grow more and more delightful. Two <orgName>English</orgName> ladies came to tea - Mrs. <persName>Morhouse,</persName> hushed and gentle and sweet - and Mrs. <persName>Aylmer,</persName> who might easily be colonel of a regiment. I believe her husband is. Yesterday was the warmest day we've had, I think, and today there has been a touch of <orgName>Khamseen</orgName> - the hot, thick wind of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. It made the sunset tonight one of opaque, almost suffocating gold.</p>

                  <p>I wonder if it's often given to human eyes to see anything more beautiful than the <placeName>Libyan Range</placeName> was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> today in all the splendor and the glamour of the late afternoon light. It strikes me with fresh joy every time I look at it from that particular place and at that hour. The <orgName>Beduin</orgName> has sunk so with the falling river that from the salon we can no longer see even the tip-top of the <orgName>Range,</orgName> and even from the upper deck we do not get it in its full majesty as they do from the <placeName>Winter Palace.</placeName> When we first tied up here we could see the <orgName>Range</orgName> and all the intervening stretch of desert and green from the salon window - which will give you some idea of how the river has dropped.</p>
                  <p>When I got back to the <placeName>Beduin I</placeName> found <persName>Mrs. Pier</persName> and the Countess having tea. They had stopped on their way home from an all day expedition to the <placeName>Valley of the Tombs of the Apes.</placeName> They had asked <persName>Doris</persName> and me to go, but we declined because <persName>Cousin T.</persName> was not feeling well.</p>

                  <p>This morning <persName>Cousin Emma</persName> and <persName>Doris</persName> went over to <placeName>Luxor</placeName> to see <persName>Mohammed Mohassib</persName> and the <placeName>Luxor</placeName> temple, etc. while <persName>Cousin Theodore</persName> and I settled ourselves with the dominoes on deck. In the middle of a game the sound of many bleats arose upon the air - ranging from deep paternal ones to tiny appealing baby calls, and over the sands came a flock of dark brown sheep with four men and some children shepherding them. They came straight to the little cove just at the stern of the <orgName>Beduin.</orgName> Three of the men stripped to the loincloth, and each grabbed a sheep and walked into the river to wash it, while the children and the fourth man kept the rest of the flock together, and one small naked boy wrestled with a ram. It was a very interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman, who spends his day over here to see that no one steals our turkeys, strolled up and ordered them away from the sacred precincts of the dahabya.</p> 
                  <p>This afternoon <persName>Doris</persName> and <persName>Cousin Theodore</persName> rode over to the diggings and I went for a long walk. My Monday attempt proved that my leg is still too lame for riding. Away to the north, standing in a row in the most obvious and posterish manner, with the far end of the <orgName>Range</orgName> as a background, are three palm trees. They look exactly like the funny pictures of the <orgName>African</orgName> desert with an artist up in one of them while a lion lashes his tail in front of a deserted easel below. Cousin <persName>Emma</persName> says she has hated those palm trees for years, and even I have got deadly tired of them this winter. So I walked to them to see if I liked them better at close range. The first part of the walk led along the sands by the river's edge where the natives are planting their melons. Vast stretches of little hillocks, with short bunches of dry cane in them to keep the sand together, show where melons have already been planted, and little oblong bunches, about the size of a large watermelon, show where others are to be planted. There ought to be an enormous crop in this immediate vicinity alone. Then I struck inland past a native village which has always looked so charming in the distance and which was very squalid really. Along a little ridge broken by shadufs and a complaining sakiheh around which a cow toiled. I like them best when a camel is working them. Camels always look so absolutely superior to anything they may be doing. I heard such a nice reason the other day for the superciliousness of the camel. <persName>Allah</persName> has one hundred names - the <persName>Faithful</persName> know ninety-nine of them but the camel knows the hundredth!...Then I cut across a cultivated little gully, climbed up the other side and, behold, the three palm trees, looking quite lovely and presiding over the very verdant outskirts of a tiny village. I came back another way and was ready for quarts of tea when I got here. {36}</p>

                  <p>And our last day here until we stop on our way down to <placeName>Cairo.</placeName> I went across to <placeName>Luxor</placeName> this morning to say good-bye to <persName>Mrs. Pier</persName> and have a final scalp treatment. The tonic they apply is made, they say, from the juice of the palm tree. This morning when the <orgName>German</orgName> youth who has had recent charge of my sparse tresses dabbed on said tonic, I exclaimed "Oh! that stings!" "Yes, madam, it is de stink of de palm" was his apt rejoinder.</p>
                  <p>Cousin <persName>Emma</persName> and I had a wondrous drive this afternoon. Neither she nor I had been to the diggings at <placeName>Medinet Habu</placeName> for weeks. When we announced we were going <persName>Cousin T.</persName> said he did not wish us to as we would interfere with the work. He and <persName>Doris</persName> go over every other day, but when we suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything. We took the felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carriage with two mules awaited us, and I was internally much amused when <persName>Cousin Emma</persName> gave the driver the simple order <persName>"Medinet Habu",</persName> for the <placeName>Valley of the Queens</placeName> was supposed to be our object. But we were crazy to see the things <persName>Harry</persName> had excavated since our last visit - namely the palace of <persName type="historical" ref="Ramses">Rameses III</persName>. We found <persName>Harry</persName> trying to take a photograph, while his hundred boys and men proceeded on their endless procession to the dumping place. The throne room and three bathrooms are what have, thus far, been brought to light. As the bathrooms open directly off the throne room, to the casual and frivolous eye it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne and a washing of hisself. On our way to our carriage we were held up by a native who produced a bandana tied up in a wad from which he took out four little carved bone images, which he told us, in a scared whisper, came from <persName>Lord Carnarvon's</persName> diggings. Cousin <persName>Emma</persName> wished to buy them for <persName>Doris,</persName> but had forgotten her purse. The man agreed to take the entire contents of mine, though it fell short of the ten shillings he asked. When too late we realized that this transaction left us with no backshis for anybody. On we went to the <placeName>Valley of the Queens</placeName> - a lovely desert drive, and to my eye a much happier valley than that of the <persName>Kings,</persName> because of the wide and beautiful view from its entrance away down to the river and on to the far <orgName>Arabian</orgName> Mts. On our arrival at the tombs and upon being confronted by the gaffir, we remembered we'd left our passes at home. But the magic name of <persName>Davis</persName> opened the way. But then we fell back in the carriage explaining we had no backshis. <persName>Broad</persName> smiles on the face of the gaffir and a courteous assurance that that made no difference. I wanted mainly to see the tomb of <persName>Nefertari</persName> so I went into that, and if that <persName>Queen</persName> was as lovely as her pictures on those walls, <persName>Rameses II</persName> must have been crazy about her.</p>
                  <p>The drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh, so calm, so scented, the barley fields such a rejoicing green, everything so beautiful in the ecstatic light of afternoon. The river reached, no backshis for the driver, but he was quite satisfied when we told him Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> would attend to that (<persName>Jones</perrsName> is almost as much a name to conjure by as <orgName>Davis.</orgName> Also there was no felucca, we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us! A <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> boat clamored for the honor of taking us to our dahabya, brutally pushing aside one lone tourist wishing to cross to said Palace. Just started in the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> boat, up dashed our own felucca, the men rowing like mad, and we were transferred, the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> boatmen perfectly satisfied when we said Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> would see them. The whole expedition was awfully amusing.</p>

                  <p>On our way up the River. We "hit the trail" (as we used to say in my beloved <placeName>wild west</placeName>) at 7:20 this morning, and it was high time for us to be moving, for <persName>Cousin Theodore</persName> was getting tired of <placeName>Luxor</placeName> and very low in his mind. And again <persName>Doris</persName> and I are in the clutch of the enchantment of these wonderful shores slipping by us. Everybody is planting melons, even on the sandbars in the middle of the river. I should think that later on the entire population would be writhing with colic. {37}</p>
