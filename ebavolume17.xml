                    <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <orgName ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</orgName> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden Age' of Egyptian archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <orgName ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</orgName> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <orgName ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</orgName> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <orgName ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington.</orgName> <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis.</persName> Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile,</placeName> including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

                <p>We have had an uneventful stupid voyage, and are due at <placeName ref="#Cherbourg">Cherbourg</placeName> tomorrow. We have had rain, cold winds, and rough seas. Very pleasant rooms.</p>

We felt some little trepidation at committing ourselves to a French railway &#8211; there has been such a history of accidents in <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName>! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired &#8211; as was shown by the piles of the old sleepers all along the road &#8211; in the most astounding state of decay &#8211; utter rottenness &#8211; they gave damning evidence of neglect. I had never seen the <placeName ref="#Brittany">Brittany</placeName> country before. How charming those wide reaching fields were, in the late afternoon light &#8211; so softly green &#8211; and the characteristic, mostly <pb n="73"/>pollarded trees in their tints of bronze and olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that looked as if they might have been painted by <persName>Troyen</persName> or <persName>Coret</persName>. It was a blissful afternoon &#8211; and we so enjoyed it. Arrived in <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> at 10 &#8211; and found <persName ref="#Rathbone">Mr. Rathbone</persName> waiting for us. They are at the <name type="hotel">Bedford</name>.</p>

Sailed at 7 A.M. &#8211; reached <persName>Nagh Hamadi</persName> at 12:15, passed the bridge and then waited until 3:30, waiting for the tug to cool &#8211; and reached <persName>Balliana</persName> at 5:30 where we wait until tomorrow &#8211; to give <persName>El&#232;na Rathbone</persName> a chance to see <persName>Abydos</persName> &#8211; and we promised the <name>Navilles</name> to lunch with them.

                <p>Started about 10 for <persName>Abydos</persName> &#8211; fearing a hot day &#8211; had 2 carriages &#8211; we found a cold north wind blowing, and we really suffered with cold. It was a market day, and the people were streaming along the dusty road &#8211; men, women carrying babies, camels, donkeys, sheep and <pb n="81"/> goats &#8211; making the air thick with dust. It is such a pity that one must always see <persName>Abydos</persName> in the glare of mid-day! Mme. <persName>Naville</persName> came up from their little house in its nest in the sandy desert, to see us &#8211; and we all went back with her &#8211; I sitting on a man's saddle on a wretched donkey, - the cold wind almost blowing my clothes off &#8211; and my eyes blinded. But the little house was cheerful and comfortable and the lunch very good, and <persName>M.</persName> and Mme. <persName>Naville</persName> very nice as they always are. Mr. <persName>Whitmore</persName> and <persName>Mr. Dixon,</persName> young men working with the <orgName>Navilles.</orgName> The ride home was away from the wind, and the fields so green and fragrant with their blossoming crops, and the birds singing everywhere. The people were in their straw houses, which they build for watching their crops &#8211; and it was very pastoral. Found a huge mail waiting for us. We steamed down to <persName>Girga,</persName> 8 miles, and are here for the night.</p>
