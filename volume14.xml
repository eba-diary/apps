          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B.

A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital">Newbook Digital</name> Texts (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <name ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington.</name> <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B.

Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

        <p>We left <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> on the 10th after spending 8 days between <placeName ref="#New_York">N.Y.</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Washington_DC">Washington</placeName>. I left an unfinished garden at <placeName ref="#Newport">Newport</placeName> - the weather for a week before we left being very stormy and bad. My flower borders I had to leave unsettled, and I shall have to manage them by long distance planting. I had hoped to have some leisure in <placeName ref="#New_York">N.Y.</placeName> but each day brought so many demands. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> arrived this morning and <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary Newberry</persName> in the afternoon. We went over to <placeName ref="#Washington_DC">Washington</placeName> on the 4th - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I stopping with <persName ref="#Boal_Terry">Terry</persName> and <persName ref="#Boal_Mathilde">Mathilde</persName> in their very charming French appartment. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> went out to <placeName ref="#Chevy_Chase">Chevy Chase</placeName>, where the <personGrp ref="#Wilsons">Wilsons</personGrp> are staying for a time, and spent a night and day with <persName ref="#Wilson_Alice">Alice</persName> - and then back to <placeName ref="#Baltimore">Baltimore</placeName> to stay with <persName ref="#Powell_Helen">Helen</persName>, until we picked her up 3 days later. I enjoyed seeing <placeName ref="#Washington_DC">Washington</placeName> again - and <persName ref="#Boal_Mathilde">Mathilde</persName> had 2 pleasant dinners for us. One day we drove out through the <placeName ref="#Rocky_Creek_Valley">Rocky Creek Valley</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Chevy_Chase">Chevy Chase</placeName>, where we had a lunch at the Country Club. We enjoyed everything during our short little visit - and especially the companionship of <persName ref="#Boal_Terry">Terry</persName> and <persName ref="#Boal_Mathilde">Mathilde</persName>. Dinners, teas and visits every day in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName>, and made me ready for the quiet of the sea voyage; and I have had a beautiful rest and pleasant occupations up here in my little sky appartment - consisting of the Captain's rooms on the bridge level. We passed the <placeName ref="#Azores">Azores</placeName> today - going quite close to the <placeName ref="#Sao_Jorge">island of St. George</placeName>.<pb n="2"/></p>

        <p>Due tomorrow early at <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName>.

        <p>Friday. We got in this morning early - a bright, clear day, but with a cold wind blowing - characteristic weather for <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> at this season. <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> so quiet - not even a cloud of smoke about it. It has changed its outline very much since the last eruption - the cone is quite lost and the mountain looks dwarfed - the crater opening is on the other side now - from <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> - and not a spark could be seen at night. We are the only guests apparently in this house except the young <persName ref="#Brunswick_Duke">Duke of Brunswick</persName> and his party whom we always see in Egypt. On his way I suppose, now. We are to be off tomorrow on the <name type="boat" ref="#SS_Schleswig">SS. Schleswig</name> for <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>.</p>

        <p>After a beautiful voyage on the comfortable <name type="boat" ref="#SS_Schleswig">Schleswig</name>, we arrived Monday afternoon, in a pouring rain at <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>. Fortunately the ship went to the dock - but the disembarking was bad enough. We just caught the train for <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. <persName ref="#Hunt_Arthur">Dr. Hunt</persName> and <persName ref="#Grenfell_Bernard">Dr. Grenfell</persName> were on the boat and we found them as always - delightful and interesting. The former especially I like. We are in our old rooms overlooking the <pb n="3"/>garden [smudged word] not many people here. It is said that all the newspapers talk of the unrest in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>, has frightened away many people. We found <persName ref="#Trefusis_Robert">Robert Trefusis</persName> waiting on the terrace at <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepeards_Hotel">Shepheards</name> for us. He is stopping here.</p>

        <p>Have paid a visit to the boat, which looks in very good and advanced readiness for us. Have shopped a little, and unpacked everything, or <persName ref="#Amelie">Amelie</persName> has, for readjustment for the winter. They have added another floor to this hotel - giving 75 new rooms - nice suites with bath rooms. <persName ref="#Baehler_Charles">Mr. Bachler</persName> is no longer manager - though he gives a certain supervision to it. He has a very nice house now in the <name type="hotel" ref="#Ghezireh_Palace_Hotel">Ghezireh Palace</name> grounds, where he lives - and is a powerful member of the Egyptian Hotels Syndicate. His character is so high and sterling, that he carries great influence and confidence. The <name type="hotel" ref="#Savoy_Hotel">Savoy hotel</name> is building an addition almost as big as itself. The <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_du_Nil">Hotel du Nil</name>, has been torn down, and is rebuilding. The <name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Hotel">Grand Hotel</placeName> comes down next summer, and a huge business block built in its place. The <name type="hotel" ref="#Ghezireh_Palace_Hotel">Ghezireh Palace Hotel</name> will also come down, and be rebuilt on modern lines. <name type="hotel" ref="#">Ritz</name> is building a charming looking hotel on the banks of the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> - a short distance from the <placeName ref="#British_Embassy">English Embassy</placeName>. The greater part of <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> is being pulled down, or built upon. The thought pervading everybody seems to be how to speculate and make the most money - and the price of land is abnormal and stupendous. <persName ref="#Hunt_Arthur">Dr. Hunt</persName> and <persName ref="#Grenfell_Bernard">Dr. Grenfell</persName> and <persName ref="Trefusis_Robert">Robert</persName> dined with us and we had a charming evening.<pb n="4"/></p>

        <p>We had <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> and <persName ref="Trefusis_Robert">Robert</persName> to dine - <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> looks ill and bad - has had a bad cold; he is sad too, and bemoaned the fact that he was growing old - and had to give up some of his activities. It seems to me very pathetic and inconsistent to hear a clergyman making such complaints. "Far above the belief and dream of material living is the Life Divine, revealing spiritual understanding and man's dominion over the whole earth".</p>

        <p>At home this morning. In the afternoon we foolishly elected to drive out to the <placeName ref="#Pyramids">Pyramids</placeName> for tea at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Mena_House_Hotel">Mena House</name> - forgetting how crowded it would be on a Sunday afternoon. The drive lost most of its pleasure and beauty from the crowd of whizzing motors that filled the air with dust and stench.

        <p>We took possession this morning of the boat. We have the tug <pb n="5"/><name type="boat" ref="#Thotmes">Thothmes</name> to draw us - a strong, staunch tug. Went through the bridge shortly after 2 o'clock - then through the new <placeName ref="#Ghizeh_Bridge">Ghizeh bridge</placeName>, and pulled up at 6:30 about 4 miles from <placeName ref="#Helwan">Helouan</placeName>. <persName ref="#Trefusis_Walter">Captain Trefusis</persName> stayed at the hotel with us, until we came away.

        <p>The strong south wind still blows - it being the 12 day of it the Captain says.

        <p>We started early, but there was a thick fog and we stuck in the sand. I looked at my clock and found it 5:30. It made me shudder in my warm bed to hear our poor men in the water, getting us off. Reached <placeName ref="#Assiout">Asy&#251;t</placeName> at 8:30 - passed through the lock which was open finely.

We have been passing through some of the most beautiful and highly cultivated country in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> for 2 days. The sugar cane crop <pb n="7"/> is almost ready for the harvest - and at this time the people come from the villages to the banks of the river, with their family, dogs, and flocks and herds, to watch their crops.

        <p>We started with the tug about 7 o'clock. It was interesting getting up into those cataract waters again, and took me back to that morning, years ago, when on the <placeName ref="#Herdotus_Basin">Herodotus</placeName> we attempted getting up, and met with such a fiasco. It was tiresome and nervous getting through the 4 different locks, because of the crowding gyassas, and the consequent noise and shrieking. We entered the first lock at 8 A.M. and passed the last at 11 o'clock. The special cataract rais for the cataract, as we came out, took the tug <pb n="10"/>immediately over a pile of loose stones under the water, nearly upsetting her, and of course we followed, the stones grinding under our whole length. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> was furious and with reason. The river above the dam was a large lake - the palm trees more or less submerged, and <placeName  ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName> standing in water. We passed <placeName ref="#Nubia">Deb&#244;t</placeName>, with its ruined Ptolemaic temple, and are now lying 2 miles above it - against a charming low desert shore. The day has been very hot - 78 on my cabana.</p>

        <p>Made an early start at 5 - and tied up at 5 P.M. The day lovely - not quite so hot as yesterday. I got up at 6 o'clock to see the lovely morning with the exquisite desert colouring - and one of the first things I saw was the ruined little <placeName ref="#Temple_of_Kertasi">temple of Kertassi</placeName>, standing in the golden yellow sands under the light of the dawn. I was so interested too in the almost continuous villages on both sides of the river, so clear and orderly, the house solidly built of stones, and with some effort at architectural effect or rather ornament and with occasional white minarets and mosques - all of these villages struggling up - over the rough bare desert. The poor palms are still standing most of them in water, looking sad enough - with their yellowing and dying fronds. Others, farther back, on dry land showing several feet up their stems the mark of the water. As the day went on, the conditions improved somewhat. The villages became so interesting and a real artistic spirit seemed abroad. The houses had ornamental brick work "&#224; jour" across their fronts - often of excellent <pb n="11"/>workmanship and design - and frequently tiles and plates were used. In some of them, the ornamental balustrade around the top seemed to enclose earth in which small shrubs were planted. Altogether very interesting. The small temples seen in this part of the river from time to time are not very attractive. I have already visited them during my two former visits.</p>

        <p>We are lying tonight between the two towns of <placeName ref="#Genena">Genena</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Shibb&#226;ik</placeName> - having made 77 miles. There are left 26 miles between this and <placeName ref="#Abu_Simbel">Abu Simbel</placeName> for tomorrow. This has been another perfect day and we have been coming through the most fertile and beautiful scenery I have seen on the <placeName ref="Nile">Nile</placeName>. We came, too, to the natural river with its current, and are free from the back water of the barrage. The palms have been magnificent - and such a rich, dark, polished green. Never have I seen such fine scent trees, and in such perfect bloom and so many of them, - large forest trees in fact. And the tamarasks look almost like English yews - so compact are they and so dark in colour. This afternoon in passing the interesting remains of the Roman fortress <placeName ref="#Qasr_Ibrim">Kasr Ibr&#226;m</placeName>, on its lofty rock, the scenery was quite beyond painting - the western side being a wonderful stretch of gold red desert, as far as the eye could see, broken by bold detached bare hills, their black iron coating making such contrasts in color. Quite too beautiful and impressive ever to be forgotten.<pb n="12"/></p>

He has his painting tent just in front of the temple. We had pleasant visits with them and said goodbye after dinner to them.</p>

On the rough stones of the corridor rested a wooden door, 12 x 14 ft. long - 6 ft. wide, and a smaller one about 2 x 4 - with bronze doors and hinges - both doors covered with gold foil - the <pb n="17"/> smaller one in quite good condition, and on it the cartouche of <persName ref="#Tiyi">Tyi,</persName> and that of her husband <persName ref="#Amenhotep_III">Amenhotep III.</persName> The burial chamber was not large, but in a state of great confusion. The <persName ref="#Tiyi">Queen</persName> would seem to have been laid in a great, highly decorated, wood shrine - parts of which were on the floor, or leaning against the wall, - the coffin on the floor - all showing hasty burial, or robbery or desecration.

Here is the sketch of the tomb and situation of objects. No. 1. mummy of <placeName ref="#Tiyi">Queen</placeName> - partly overlaid by coffin No. 2 - both on the floor. 3,3,3,3, doors or panels - very large, heavily overlaid with gold, - the one with the x, has a beautiful portrait of <placeName ref="#Tiyi">Queen.</placeName> All of them beautifully incised on the gold leaf. <persName ref="#Aten">Aton</persName> rays on all and <persName ref="#Akhenaten">Khuenatens</persName> cartouche followed by an inscription "I made this for the great <placeName ref="#Tiyi">Queen Tyi,</placeName> royal mother".

        <p>We were overwhelmed with people this A.M. A <personGrp ref="#Crocker">Mr. and Mrs. Crocker</personGrp> introduced by letter from the <personGrp ref="#Folger">Folgers,</personGrp> and <persName ref="#White_Mr">Mr. White</persName>. They both brought boat loads of people with them - a nuisance and impertinence! <persName ref="#Hall_Mr">Mr. Hall</persName> also came, but we lost the pleasure of his visit, by this crowd. 17 people at once in our little salon, is too much. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> in the valley, they got home early, as <persName ref="#Cromer">Lord and Lady Cromer</persName> were coming at 5 o'clock. The <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigalls,</persName> and a <persName ref="#Villiers_Eric">Mr. Eric Villiers</persName> saw the things and then came the <personGrp ref="#Cromer">Cromers</personGrp> and <persName ref="Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero,</persName> and <persName ref="#Cromer_Lady">Lady Cromer</persName> was much interested and he much more so than he seemed. They were entranced with the boat and especially with my room. She is quite charming and he is interesting because of his achievements, and because of the power he wields.</p>

        <p><persName ref="Hall_Mr">Mr. Hall</persName> lunched with us. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> was in <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor</name> this A.M. and <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> told him of various small and precious things which had been shown him by a native which had been stolen from <placeName ref="#Tiyi">Tyi's</placeName> tomb. The man had told <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Mr. Davis</persName> could have them all for Â£400. - provided no attempt at arrest was made! These fellows are difficult to deal with. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> told <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> if the men would produce everything they had, and would show them, he might consider a price and promise no arrests to be made. Their practice is to mass together a lot of valuable things on such an occasion, with what has been stolen from a late find, and try to get a big price for all. Later in the day <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> went into <persName ref="#el_Hamed_Abd">Abd el Hamed's</persName> and <persName ref="#Ali">Ali's</persName> shops on the river, and the latter handed him several small objects from the tomb - some gold "neferts" from the necklace, carnelian lotus flowers, and a lovely bit of gold and enamel from a necklace - only one of which we have - and it is marked No. 17 in hieroglyphic characters. <persName ref="#Ali">Ali</persName> would not take anything for these - among them one bearing <persName ref="#Aten">Aten's</persName> cartouche. It is humiliating to find that thieves have been among your trusted workmen - they have such chances in sifting d&#232;bris, to hide a valuable thing in their loose clothes. <persName ref="#Lythgoe_Albert">Mr. Lythgoe</persName> and <persName ref="#Henckel_Countess">Countess Henckel</persName> and her daughter <persName ref="#Hahn_Countess">Countess Hahn</persName> came to tea - and <personGrp ref="#Fatio">M. and Mme.
