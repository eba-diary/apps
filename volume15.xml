                <p>This little record of travel should have begun a month ago - as we sailed from <placeName>New York</placeName> just a month ago - the 2d of Nov. on the <name type="boat">Freiderick der Grosse.</name> We had a rough unpleasant passage - there was no day on which I could have written with comfort. It was the worst passage I ever made. On some days, the best thing was to stay in bed - and that was a difficult thing to do. A friend of ours was thrown from his berth, and dislocated his shoulder - several accidents occured - sprains etc. Reached <placeName>Naples</placeName> finally the morning of the 15th. Dr. <persName>Baldwin</persName> of <persName>Rome,</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Beck</persName> of <persName>Milwaukie,</persName> were on the boat, and added much to the pleasure of the voyage - coming when possible to my sitting room for tea. We knew that <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> would be waiting for us at <placeName>Naples,</placeName> and we hoped to have at least a night and day with <persName>Nettie</persName> at the <placeName>Grand Hotel.</placeName> But we were so belated that we had only time to drive to the hotel and get them, and drive back to the dock - and that was so disappointing. <persName>David Costantini</persName> was there also - and Mrs. <persName>Baldwin</persName> who had come from <placeName>Rome</placeName> to meet her husband - the voyage across the <orgName>Mediterranean</orgName> was as charming as the other was horrid. We arrived at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> at 8 o'clock on Monday the 18th, stopped at the <placeName>New Khedivial Hotel</placeName> long enough to have a lunch put up for us, then paid a visit to the <orgName>Museum (our</orgName> first) though it is hardly worth a visit, and were off for <placeName>Cairo</placeName> at noon - and found our old rooms ready for us, and were eating dinner on the evening of the 16th. A sister with them - a quiet, beautiful day from <placeName>N.Y.</placeName> A very good record. We got away from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> today - having settled ourselves on the <orgName>Beduin</orgName> the 1st. We tried to get through the bridge yesterday - but there was such a crowd of gyassas at the draw, that we waited for most of them, dreading the dangers of that shouting, reckless, unmanageable crowd - but the <persName>Bridge</persName> time was up before they had all passed, and the draw was shut in our faces. We tied up at the <placeName>Kasr el Nil</placeName> barracks, and waited for today. We were so near when the draw was opened at 1 o'clock that we started as soon as the down boats had got through - but there was a good wind, and the reckless gyassas in spite of orders and shreiks of the bridge officers crowded upon us in full sail - and it was a very nasty twenty mimrtes we had - such noise, such frantic efforts. One of them crashed her bow into us, fortunately broke her bow sprit, and left her anchor embedded in the landing stage, or she would have ripper our side open. She did break one of the window frames, but luckily spared the glass, knocked much of our nice new paint off us etc. One of our men took out the window frame, and we left him in <placeName>Cairo,</placeName> to take it to the carpenters and painters. He rejoined us at <placeName>Tourah</placeName> by rail and says the carpenters and painters will reach <placeName>Bedreshein</placeName> tomorrow at 8 o'clock. As <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> are to make a visit to <placeName>Sakkarah</placeName> we will not be detained. We saw Capt. <persName>Trefusis</persName> and his sweet sister <persName>Evelyn</persName> who is out with him this winter. They lunched with us several times, and she came in to stay one night (they are staying at <placeName>Helouan)</placeName> and go with <persName>Carrie</persName> early the next morning to see the ceremony of the <orgName>Kishwa.</orgName> He is now in a large business at <placeName>Cairo.</placeName> We also made the acquaintance of Lord [illegible]'s eldest son, <persName>Viscount Fielding.</persName> He is in the <placeName>Coldstream Guards,</placeName> who have lately been sent out here. He is a nice young fellow simple and natural. <persName>Mrs. Peck</persName> of <placeName>Milwaukie</placeName> was at <placeName>Shepheards</placeName> most of the time we were there, and we saw much of her. <name>Cairo,</name> and the whole of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> is now in serious financial straits, following the absurd speculative craze of the last 2 years. Prices are incredibly high.</p>

        <p>  Tuesday, Dec. 3rd. I have had a busy day settling - while <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to <placeName>Sakkarah.</placeName> A lovely day. The <persName>Ramesis</persName> was lying by us all day - with a handful of passengers - but went off at 6 o'clock. The carpenter and painter have been here all day repairing damages. Wednesday, Dec. 4. 41 miles. We get away from <persName>Bedraschein</persName> at 7 o'clock this morning - and have had a lovely day - river like glass, both of our sails out much of the time. The river is enormously broad about here. When I went on deck about 4 o'clock, I found a scene of ravishing beauty - the broad smooth river, the distant cliffs and Mts. and desert, with the heliotrope shadows, and the soft brilliant sun. It was too entrancing. We had tea on deck - and are now lying opposite <placeName>Wasta.</placeName> <placeName>Thursday,</placeName> Dec. 5th. 29 miles. A quiet uneventful day - though the tug went on the sand once for a few minutes. It is a slow heavy tug, but was the only one cook had reoccupied. We are about a mile above Ribbeh. Friday, Dec. 6th. 25 miles. Our tug, <persName>Anubis</persName> by name, went on the sand soon after nine this morning, and got off at 10:25. The river is so very broad here, that it is difficult to find the channel. The gyassas seemed to be having as much trouble as we had. Such a wonderful sunset - the sky, crimson pink with one long narrow cloud near the horizon, above which shone <persName>Venus,</persName> quite resplendent, and the new moon, the veriest silver thread of a little crescent, just below the cloud. Saturday, Dec. 7. 44 miles. Made an early start - and tied up at 5:30 within 3 miles of <placeName>Minia.</placeName> Lovely day, and perfect evening. Second Sunday in <placeName>Advent.</placeName> Dec. 8th. 28-1/2 miles. A very heavy fog on the river this morning delayed our starting until 9:25 - spent about 2 hours at <placeName>Minia</placeName> waiting for mail and express parcels - a good sailing day - tied up at <placeName>Redah</placeName> about 6 o'clock. Monday. Dec. 9th. 41-1/2 miles. Started at 6 o'clock - a cloudy day - and cold wind. Passed <persName>Mellawi, Hadji Kandel,</persName> and the <persName>Gebel Abu Feda</persName> and pulled up opposite <persName>Menfalout</persName> at 6 o'clock. We missed our channel this afternoon and had to go back to find it. It was a wonderful sight passing the <persName>Gebel.</persName> In all the years I have been on the <orgName>Nile,</orgName> I have not see such a transcendently beautiful sunset - and the colour reflected from the rocks made a great effect. Tuesday, Dec. 10. Asyut. 8 miles. Arrived at 1 o'clock having had the tug one hour on the sand. <persName>Theo</persName> dismissed the tug at 2 o'clock and we sailed at 3:30 - quite a good wind until 6 p.m. at which hour we tied up for the night, 8 miles above <placeName>Asyut.</placeName> It seemed very good to get rid of the tug. They are only tolerable to make speed, and this one couldn't do it. Last year the <name>Thothmes</name> took us in 10 days to <persName>Luxor.</persName> This year the <persName>Anubis</persName> took 9 days to go to Asy&#251;t. Wednesday, Dec. 11th. 19 miles. We had no wind until noon - but a very good one until 5:40 when we tied up and with the towing we did before noon we made our 19 miles - lovely and warm. Thursday, Dec. 12. Sohag. 41-1/2 miles. Started at 7 - the wind freshened finely at 8 o'clock and we came splendidly on until within a mile of the <placeName>Sohag</placeName> about 7 o'clock we struck the sand sharply - and were there 3/4 of an hour. Earlier in the afternoon we came near having a serious experience, - just as we approached the landing stage at <placeName>Tahta</placeName> which was crowded with gyassas and people, the wind shifted, and at that moment a gyassas, crowded with people, pushed out before our prow. We could give her no room - in spite of the yells and cries of our men she came on - and disaster seemed certain for if we had struck her we would have capsized here and gone over her. It is impossible to say why this kind of thing occurs so often - it is one of the greatest dangers on the <placeName ref="Nile">Nile</placeName>. A delightful day. Friday, Dec. 13. 28-1/2 miles. We waited at <placeName>Sohgg</placeName> this morning until 9:30 for mail and provisions. Stopped within 4 miles of <placeName>Balliana</placeName> at 6 P.M. A good wind, a heavenly day. The nights too, with the young moon and the resplendent <orgName>Venus,</orgName> are wonderful. Saturday, Dec. 14. 8-1/2 miles. A perfectly calm morning - but tracking and polling we made <persName>Balliana</persName> at 4:30 - no mail, so we were off at once, and with a light wind went on until 6 P.M. Sunday - Third in Advent. Dec. 15. 6 miles. A perfectly windless day - bright and hot. Our men have worked like <name>Trojans</name> every minute of the day - polling and tracking, we think we have made 6 miles. <name>Monday,</name> Dec. 16. A repetition of yesterday - clear, hot, windless day. The men have been polling, tracking, pulling to anchor in the burning sun all day. <persName>Theo</persName> thinks we have made about 12 miles. We are now at <placeName>Nagh Hamadi,</placeName> waiting to pass the bridge tomorrow. Tuesday, Dec. 17. 30 miles. <persName>Keneh.</persName> We got quietly through the bridge at 8 o'clock this morning. Found the <orgName>Istar</orgName> lying there, closed, and with flags down. Her men said that Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> had gone to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to see his dentist. We have had a splendid day and fine wind, and are now lying at <placeName>Dendera,</placeName> as <persName>Theo</persName> wants <persName>Carrie</persName> to see it tomorrow. Wednesday, Dec. 18. 18 miles. We got off as soon as <persName>T.</persName> and <persName>C.</persName> came back from the <orgName>Temple,</orgName> about 11 o'clock - and with good wind came to within 4 miles of <placeName>Nagadah.</placeName> Thursday, Dec. 19 21 miles. Started early, 6 o'clock, hoping to make <placeName>Luxor</placeName> tonight, but are tied up 4 miles below it. Very contrary and shifting wind - and cold - pulled to the anchor for hours. Beautiful night. Friday, Dec. 20. <persName>Luxer</persName> at last, arriving at 10:30 this morning. Came to our usual mooring place opposite the Castle - and soon the men were busy settling us. A huge mail waiting for us. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to <placeName>Karnac</placeName> this afternoon. Saturday, Dec. 21. I was at home all day. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> to look at the pit tomb <persName>Ayrton</persName> wrote about. They opened it - it proved only a pit with large vases - some sealed - some more or less broken. They report our little house finished, but too damp to live in at present - though <persName>Ayrton</persName> is living in one room. The <orgName>Miriam,</orgName> with tug <orgName>Thothmes</orgName> got in about 5 P.M. I received a note from <persName>Madame Maspero.</persName> They leave early tomorrow morning - bound for <placeName>Asw&#226;n,</placeName> and <placeName>Halfa.</placeName> One of the most wonderful moon rises this evening. Fourth Sunday in Advent. Dec. 22nd. Theor and <persName>Carri</persName> again to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> - but <persName>Carrie</persName> this time on a donkey - an exquisite day. I have had a beautiful quiet Sunday. This morning I was amused watching the loading of 2 camels with all our furnishings for our house in the <placeName>Valley.</placeName> One of the camels had the most delicious young camel with her - about a month old I should think, a lovely creature - so affectionate to its mother and so full of life and pranks. Monday, Dec. 23rd. All went over to the town this morning - <persName>Carrie</persName> and I to see <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> - then to <persName>Mrs. Weigalls</persName> and saw the new baby - and I delivered the cup I brought over for <persName>Corinna Smith.</persName> Then I went to see poor <persName>Mrs. Murch</persName> - who is most sad - but very brave. Then we encountered <persName>Theo</persName> on our way home - and stopped at the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> to see the Iddings. Mr. <persName>Iddings,</persName> the girl, <persName>Carrie</persName> and <persName>Theo</persName> went to <placeName>Karnak</placeName> at 4 o'clock and <persName>Mrs. Iddings</persName> came over and had tea with me. Tuesday, Dec. 24. I have been busy all day in the boat, first getting my pots of bulbs into order - then the Christmas presents for the men - in which <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> helped - and so did not go out - the morning lovely, but cold high winds this afternoon. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went at 3 o'clock to <placeName>Medinet Habu.</placeName> Dec. 25. Wednesday. Christmas. A beautiful winters day - the distribution of presents to the men went off successfully. Mr. <persName>Ayrton</persName> came over to spend the night, and Mr. and Mrs. Iddings came to dine - and we had a concert from the men, which amused the <orgName>Iddings</orgName> very much. Thursday, Dec. 26. <persName>Carrie</persName> and I went over to the <placeName>Winter Palace</placeName> to lunch with the Iddings. They had such pleasant rooms - and the whole house looked very attractive. <persName>Carrie</persName> and <persName>Theo</persName> to <persName>Der el Bahari</persName> in the afternoon. Friday, Dec. 27. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went over to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> for lunch, and had Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Iddings</persName> and their girls to lunch in the little house. They were delighted. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> called in the afternoon. Saturday, Dec. 28. A quiet day, mostly at home. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> at the <placeName>Weigalls</placeName> for tea, and afterwards met the <name>Iddings</name> at <placeName>Karnae.</placeName> Sunday, Dec. 29. The <name>Iddings</name> came over this morning to say good-bye - were very nice and friendly. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> at dinner. Monday, Dec. 30. Over in <placeName>Luxor</placeName> this morning - <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Mr. Sayce</persName> at shops. <name>Tuesday,</name> Dec. 31. At last a windless day. The <persName>Misses Collins</persName> came to tea - such a pleasant visit. Jan. 1. 1908. We went over to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> this morning for the day - <persName>Theodore</persName> having invited Sir <persName>Malcolm McIlwraith</persName> and his wife to lunch with us. A sister was with them - a quiet, beautiful day. Jan. 2nd. Another quiet fine day. <persName>Theo</persName> paid some visits in <placeName>Luxor,</placeName> and took <persName>Carrie</persName> to the races this afternoon. Jan. 3rd. Mr. <persName>Edmund Hayes</persName> and his daughter lunched with us, and <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went with them after to <name>Der el Medinet,</name> and <placeName>Medinet Habu.</placeName> Jan. 4th A warm wind - quiet day at home for me, <persName>Theo</persName> and Carry to <persName>Karnak.</persName> Jan. 5th. Mr. <persName>Erskine</persName> to dinner. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> this morning - coming home he reports a promising tomb in sight - thinks it will take several days to clear the doorway. Jan. 6th. At home all day. <persName>Theo</persName> at <placeName>Karnak.</placeName> Jan. 7th. Mr. <persName>Haynes</persName> called to say goodbye. Jan. 8th. <persName>Theo</persName> at the <placeName>Valley</placeName> today - very hot. He thinks the tomb will prove only a pit tomb. Mr. <persName>Erskine</persName> lunched with us and <persName>Ayrton</persName> came over for the night. Jan. 9th. The tomb proves to be a shaft 30 ft. long - with a room about 20 ft. Water has been in it. Jan. 10th. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> to <persName>Karnac.</persName> I had a delightful visit from Mrs. Gardner. Jan. 11th. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> a long ride into the country. Jan. 12th. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> at the <placeName>Valley.</placeName> The tomb proves to be filled with an accretion of gravel and dried mud 5 ft. deep - exceedingly hard. <persName>Ayrton</persName> began the clearing this morning - at the S.W. corner, and on reaching 2 ft. from the bottom, came upon a deposit of silver and gold objects of most unique importance and value. They were busy with these all afternoon - containing cartouches of <placeName>Sety II</placeName> and <placeName>Tausert</placeName> - all of which <persName>Theo</persName> brought home with him. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Weigall,</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Craggs</persName> and <persName>Ayrton</persName> to dinner. Jan. 13th. <persName>Ayrton</persName> here all day - inexpressibly shocked to hear of dear <persName>Miss Frances Collins'</persName> death in church last evening. She was playing the organ in the little chapel and was in the midst of the "Gloria" when she suddenly stood up and fell to the floor dead! It was a beautiful passing away of her lovely, useful spirit. Jan. 14. Tuesday. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to <name>Karnac</name> at 4 o'clock. Mr. <persName>Winlock</persName> called with letter of introduction from <persName>Harold Jones.</persName> Jan. 16. Wednesday. Cold, cloudy day. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> to the <placeName>Valley.</placeName> Several beads etc. had been found. Jan. 16th. Thursday. Mr. <persName>Humphreys</persName> called and <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> and friend. Cloudy cold day - strong <persName>S. W.</persName> wind. <persName>Carrie</persName> and I went over to the <persName>Luxor,</persName> to see the two old <orgName>Miss Collins</orgName> - so sad. Jan. 17th. Friday. Mr. and Mrs. <persName>Elliot Smith</persName> and her sister called soon after breakfast on their way to the Valley. We started ourselves after they left, as the <orgName>Gorsts</orgName> were to lunch with us. They arrived in time. Sir <persName>Eldon, Lady Gorst,</persName> his Sec. and <persName>Mrs. Weigall.</persName> It was a very pleasant lunch. I liked Sir <persName>Eldon</persName> very much - <persName>Lady G.</persName> exceedingly pretty and chic. <persName>Ayrton</persName> found a few more small gold objects yesterday. The <persName>Gorsts</persName> came to tea with us after we got home, to see all the gold. Jan. 18. Saturday. We had the whole <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> party to tea this afternoon to see the find. The <orgName>Duke, the Duchess,</orgName> her daughter <persName>Lady Gasford,</persName> and <persName>Lord Gasford</persName> and their daughter <persName>Lady Theodora Guest</persName> - with <persName>Mr. Weigall.</persName> THey looked at the gold things with great interest - at all the things in the boat, and begged for photographs of the boat and other things. The <orgName>Duke,</orgName> now a very old and broken man, is of course a great personage - and I was very interested in meeting him. He seemed more interested in the boat and its fittings, and was much amused with our chicken yard out on the sand. The <persName>Duchess,</persName> so celebrated in her way, was a wonderful old woman - painted and enamelled, with reddish wig, an old black hat, with painted lips - very keen to see everything. <persName>Lady Gosford</persName> very different, as nice as possible, and her husband and daughter were very pleasant. I heard the <persName>Duchess</persName> talking to Mr. <persName>Davis</persName> about how the <persName>Gorsts</persName> enjoyed their lunch yesterday in the <placeName>Valley House,</placeName> and I know from what she said that she intended <persName>Theo</persName> should invited them also to lunch there, and I don't think he will be able to escape it. 19th Sunday after Epiphany. <name>Jan,</name> 19. <persName>Theo</persName> was again in the <placeName>Valley</placeName> today, with <persName>Mr. Winlock.</persName> <persName>M. Maspero</persName> and <persName>M. Lortet</persName> called and I showed them the gold things. Jan. 20, Monday. <persName>Theo</persName> again in the <placeName>Valley</placeName> with <persName>M. Lacau</persName> to lunch - quite cold. Jan. 21. Tuesday. The 2 <persName>Miss McKewus</persName> called today. <persName>Ayrton</persName> to tea. <persName>Ayrton</persName> to tea. A note from <persName>"Louisa" Duchess</persName> of <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> tells <persName>Theo</persName> that they are going to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> on Thursday, and will be happy to accept Mr. <persName>Davin's</persName> invitation to lunch! Jan. 22. Wednesday. <persName>Theo</persName> again to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> to meet <persName>M. Maspero, Erakine</persName> and <persName>Weigall,</persName> and entered the new tomb. This was uncovered a few days since, but was shallow, and contained only some remains of workmens houses, and a number of large vases - filled with broken potsherds and small objects - the most important being a head about 7 in. high, which crowned the head of a mummied bird. <persName>Major Watson,</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Graham,</persName> an <orgName>English</orgName> woman came to tea and were shown the find, when <persName>Theo</persName> was in the valley this A.M. they opened a jar found in the gold tomb. It contained a broken vase, which was beautifully enamelled and bearing the cartouche of <placeName>Sety II.</placeName> This can be restored - also an alabaster vase, broken, with cartouche of <orgName>Rameses II,</orgName> of very good work. A lovely warm day. Mr. <persName>Erskine</persName> dined with us. Jan. 23rd. Thursday. <persName>Theo</persName> over in the <placeName>Valley</placeName> all day, having the <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> party to lunch. <persName>Carrie</persName> and I considerately stayed at home. Quite warm. Jan. 24. Friday. A quiet day for all at home. This afternoon Mr. <persName>Erskine</persName> came to say goodbye. <persName>M.</persName> and <persName>Madame Maspero</persName> with their sons came to see the find. Jan. 25. Saturday. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to <placeName>Karnac</placeName> this P.M. Jan. 26. Third Sunday after Epiphany. <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Carrie</persName> went to the <placeName>Valley</placeName> - in a very cold wind storm - the dust quite frightful.

The big boom was taken down this morning, and we are ready to go down tomorrow. Feb. 14. Friday.

The first door of the tomb is cleared - the corridor filled with rubbish. <persName>Ayrton</persName> crawled through with great difficulty and said he could see another door quite filled up. <persName>Theo</persName> thinks it an 18th dynasty tomb. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Spreston</persName> called this evening, bringing a letter of introduction from <persName>Everard Fielding.</persName> She was a <orgName>Miss de Trafford.</orgName> The <persName>McKeever</persName> girls and Mr. <persName>Forbes</persName> called before dinner, and Mr. <persName>Dalison</persName> this evening.

They found it very difficult and hot. It soon declared itself as the tomb of <placeName>Heromheb</placeName> - a very long tomb - with corridors, well, fully fresh, of <persName>Gods,</persName> a magnificent <orgName>Sarcophagus,</orgName> and figures in wood and marble - a few bones - no mummy - 200 ft. long.
