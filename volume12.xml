          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</name> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the <orgName ref="#'Golden_Age'">'Golden Age'</orgName> of <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</name> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <name ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington</name>. <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis</persName>. Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <orgName ref="#Nile">Nile</orgName>, including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the <placeName ref="#Valley">Valley</placeName> of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering <orgName ref="#Egyptologists">Egyptologists</orgName> of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

        <p>We left home very reluctantly on the 1st and went to <placeName ref="#Boston">Boston</placeName> where we spent five charming days and on the 6th moved on to <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> where we found that the <name type="boat" ref="#USS_Pocahontas">Irene</name> would be four days late in sailing in consequence of some accident to her machinery. It was tremendously vexing to us, as we lost our <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> steamer to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - and shall have to take our chance when we reach there, with what we can find. I saw some old friends in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName>, and made some pleasant visits, and to my great pleasure <persName ref="#Rogers_Mary">Mary Rogers</persName> who was staying in <placeName ref="#Orange_New_York">Orange</placeName>, came over and spent two days with me. I found my rooms (we came aboard the <date when="1904-11-16">16th</date> and sailed early in the day) on the steamer most delightful - they are the Captain's rooms - very good sitting room - big bed room, and adjoining bath room, on the level of the bridge, and I am all alone with only the sea, and the life boats about me, and the Captain near in the chart room. It has been most delightful - and the quiet and the rest very precious. During the first night, we ran into a heavy storm and high seas - which resolved itself into a cyclone, from which or out of which the Captain retreated by turning south, and running 100 miles out of his course. I hadn't a qualm of sickness, but I stayed in bed, as there was so much movement, and as <persName ref="#Amelie">Amelie</persName> was too ill to leave her room. Up at this height I got more motion - and how the wind roared and shrieked! I have never heard anything like it. The whole boat, as it were, took<pb n="54"/> to its bed. Then followed two or three days of heavy rain - and then we emerged into comparatively calm seas and brilliant sunshine - I have a door opening from my sitting room on my own private deck, and one from my bath room, so that I get all the air I want - and my private view, as it were, at any moment I want the limitless sea, and the heavens, which are wonderful beyond description now at night, with the full moon, and perfectly cloudless. This fine, steady steamer is not so fast as some - and we expected to take 12 days instead of 11 to <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> - which is the usual one - but the storms have so delayed us, that we did not reach <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> until the <date when="1904-11-11">11th</date> - yesterday - and we will make <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> only the day after tomorrow, the 14th day of the voyage, where <persName ref="#Wilson_Alice">Alice Wilson</persName> will join us for the winter.</p>

        <p><persName ref="#Amelie">Amelie</persName> called me at 6 o'clock this morning as I had asked her to - I love to see the early dawn on <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> and the bay.

        <p>We left <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> on Saturday, the 3d and made the weary, weary journey of 9 hours from there to <placeName ref="">Brindisi</placeName> - <persName ref="">Miss Hale, Mrs. Perkins</persName>, and <persName ref="">Miss Morgan</persName> were along. <persName ref="">Theodore</persName> took <personGrp ref="">the girls</personGrp> and <persName ref="">Ream</persName> and <persName ref="">Smith</persName> to <placeName ref="">Pompeii</placeName> one day at <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> - and one of the pleasantest things I did was visiting Mr. and <persName ref="">Mrs. Hanser</persName> at their charming villa at <placeName ref="">Posillipo</placeName>. They are such kind nice people. One cold, windy afternoon we drove up to the <placeName ref="">Vomero</placeName>, and after much searching found the <placeName ref="">Sprenger-M&#252;ller</placeName> place which for 3 years I have been trying to discover. But he was not at home, greatly to my regret - though Mrs. <persName ref="">Hanser</persName> told me that as he was quite deaf, I would have found him difficult. I wanted to see his garden and talk to him - for he is a noted hybridigia and floriculturist. We had to spend the night and most of the day at that hideous hotel at <placeName ref="">Brindisi</placeName> - which we thought worse than usual. When we stumbled late at night out of the <orgName>R.R</orgName>. station, and got into the omnibus, <persName ref="">Jean, Alice</persName> and I - we found it already occupied by a large man who said to me, "I guess we're going to have some fresh <orgName>Americans</orgName> on board"; <personGrp ref="">the girls<personGrp> said I replied in a chilling manner, "Yes, we are <orgName>Americans"</orgName> - "I thought so" he replied, it's so nice to hear the real thing"! While we might all be proud of being <orgName>Americans</orgName>, I don't think we relished being told in that nasal voice that we were the "real thing". Over the miseries of that 3 days voyage I will not linger! We were happy to land at <placeName ref="">Port Said</placeName> at 9 o'clock A.M. Wednesday Dec. 7th, and soon were<pb n="56"/> journeying to <placeName ref="">Cairo</placeName> by the new and improved route - an hour shorter than formerly - met all our nice people and established in time for tea in our charming appartment here.</p>

        <p>Very busy getting the <orgName>Beduin</orgName> in order - and arranging to send <persName ref="">Abdul</persName>, with his wife and child up to his native country <placeName ref="">Dongola</placeName> - <persName ref="">Abdul</persName> has recovered remarkably - and seems stronger than he has been for three years - but we found that he had been drinking a good deal - and we decided it was better for him to go back to his own people - and to a warmer climate where he will be free from temptation. He has a bit of land there, and some palm trees, and <persName ref="">Theodore</persName> has arranged for <persName ref="">Cook</persName> to send him money from time to time - and it seems a happy solution to the dondition which has given us a good deal of anxiety lately.</p>

        <p>We came on board this morning - a cold day with strong <placeName ref="">South</placeName> wind blowing - and of course no prospect of sailing - but we were so glad to give up hotel life, and take possession once more of this little home. <placeName ref="">Cairo</placeName> did not seem very pleasant. We had heavy fogs each morning - and yesterday we had a fire built in our sitting room. We dined with <persName ref="">Miss Morgan</persName> and her brothers one evening - and had a charming evening. They have altered the <orgName>Sandwith</orgName> house - made it much larger - and is just finishing a magnificent ball room - one of the most lovely rooms of the kind I have ever seen. The boys, <persName ref="">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="">Ream</persName>, have gone up the<pb n="57"/> river on one of <orgName>Cooks</orgName> steamers - Mr. <persName ref="">Carter</persName> dined and lunched with us several times - and we spent the day with him at the <placeName ref="">Mona House</placeName>, where he was staying. He is quite settled in a pleasant appartment - and looks better and happier than he did. We had tea one afternoon with <persName ref="">Mrs. Packett</persName>, in her nice little home. I liked her husband - and she seemed quieter and less gushing than the <orgName>Miss Kirkbride</orgName> we met a year ago on the steamer coming out here.</p>

        <p>Came through the bridge yesterday and are lying near the <orgName>British</orgName> embassy. <persName ref="">Alice, Jean</persName> and I walked all about the streets near us this morning - they are so wide and well paved and shaded, that we found it very pleasant - we dared not go far from the boat, as the wind seemed at last to be changing. Any number of really handsome houses have been built in this quarter. At noon the wind fell - and it was quite warm - about 3:30 it came gently from the north, and we spread our sails and went away before it. The <orgName>Agiz</orgName> also put out, and the <orgName>Isis</orgName>, with a <placeName ref="#Boston">Boston</placeName> man, <persName ref="">Brooks</persName>, with the <name>Tucks, and<pb n="58"/> <persName ref="">Miss Morgan</persName>, going to <placeName ref="">Sakkarah</placeName>, also started. We made about 6 miles, and are almost in sight of <orgName>Helouan</orgName>. The afternoon has been beautiful - and we sailed gently along the island of <placeName ref="">Rhodah</placeName> - the old dilapidated palaces looking so picturesque - and the evening lights so fine - the 3 boats are lying near each other tonight.</p>

We were soon off in a light wind - the river was crowded with boats, and we got into a great mix with them, and one of them caught her boom into our beautiful white sail and tore two holes in it, so we were obliged to stop and repair damages: <persName ref="">Isis</persName> and <persName ref="">Agiz</persName> ahead of us. We have made about 3 miles, and are lying opposite <placeName ref="">Tura</placeName>.</p>

        <p>We began sailing about 11 o'clock - the wind grew strong and we went dashing along in rather an alarming way. Then a sudden squall struck us - we had to drop our sails, and were driven to shore - a wildly exciting time getting our sails furled - and we lay the rest of the day rocking under bare poles. As the evening drew on the wind fell, and we were able to cross the river and find a better place. Such a heavenly night! a full moon - and grand palm trees above us on the bank. Made 7 miles.</p>

But as a favourable wind began to rise <persName ref="">Theodore</persName> sent out word that they must be off - so up came our stakes and we started in a fair wind and kept on until about 5 o'clock - we came to a difficult bend in the river and stopped for the night.

        <p>A gentle sailing breeze all day - occasionally dying out. Passed <persName ref="">Beni Hassan</persName> about 11 o'clock. <persName ref="">Rhodah</persName> at 3 - and are now within a mile or so of <placeName ref="">Mellawie</placeName> - a charming really warm day. We have been immersed in the newspapers - and in the extraordinary news of the protracted siege of <placeName ref="">Port Arthur</placeName>. What a slaughter - what heroism on the part of the <orgName>Japanese</orgName> - what hopeless demoralization and incompetency of the <orgName>Russians</orgName> - a harrowing thing to think of.</p>

        <p>A very exciting day - we began early in a gentle enough manner - but the wind steadily grew stronger and when we came to the great turn at the approach to the <persName ref="">Gebel Abu Feda</persName> the <persName ref="">Reis</persName> took to the bank and furled his sail. There we stayed for 3<pb n="63"/> hours, when he thought it safe to go out again. The river is now so full of gyassas, that sailing is sometimes risky - as we entered the part of the river under the cliffs, there were many of them about, and in the gale which broke upon us, we came nearly to our destruction by one of these bearing down upon us, quite unmanageable. The shrieking of the wind, the cries of the sailors were exciting. At one time we had 13 men on the boom trying to furl the sail - as soon as we found ourselves able, we dropped our anchors, and after, pulled to shore - thankful enough to make ourselves fast. The worst experience we have ever had.</p>

I was in my chair and the donkeys were not very good. And the detestable Sugar people have spoiled every thing on this side. Those lovely rides we used to have through those smiling fields, are gone now forever! They have built canals and railways to carry their sugar cane - and the jolting, noisy little trains are always hustling up and down with their loads of sugar cane.

They said they might clear it to the entrance in a few days. Very encouraging.</p>

        <p>A <persName ref="#Porch_Mr.">Mr. Porch</persName> came to lunch with <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Mr. Weigall</persName>. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> met him the other day. He is English, a devot&#233; to flints. He has been encamped near <placeName ref="">G&#251;rna</placeName>, at the mouth of a little rock tomb, he is a handsome agreeable little fellow - seems to know every one - and especially all <placeName ref="#Italy">Italy</placeName> and Italians. He travels everywhere with an Italian servant who would seem to be a half savant. His ancestral home in <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName><pb n="74"/> is <placeName ref="#Glastonbury">Glastenbury Abbey</placeName> - he goes very soon to <placeName ref="#India">India</placeName> - with this servant and a camel he has come all the way from the <placeName ref="#Red_Sea">Red Sea</placeName> to <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor</name>. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigall</persName> rode over to the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley of the Kings</placeName> this afternoon - when <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> got home he brought with him two or three queer parcels - and he had an air of great elation. He first unwrapped a yoke of a chariot, finely decorated in gold and colour - in perfect condition, then a long baton, or wand of office - also finely decorated - then produced a large beautiful green, hard stone scarab, with gilded bands, beautifully inscribed even to the wings. He said that the workmen had reached the door of the tomb chamber, and they went down into it. A small aperture had been broken in this door, large enough to admit a man. This door was of stone, plastered with mud - with many seals on it - and the tomb had been broken into in ages gone by - for the things <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> found in the corridor and brought home, had no doubt been dropped by the thieves. <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigall</persName> remained behind, to sleep with the guards at the tomb, and <personGrp ref="#Smith">Mr. and Mrs. Smith</personGrp> also went over to stay with him. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> wrote a note to <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M.

        <p>We all made an early start for the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley</placeName> this morning. <persName ref="#Wilson_Alice">Alice</persName> has not been feeling very well for a few days - and was so melancholy at the idea of being left behind on the opening day of the tomb, that I persuaded <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> to send for one of the <name type="boat" ref="">Victorias</name> that occasionally take people over - and she and I rode over most comfortably. We had to<pb n="75"/> go on our donkeys across the wide sand waste - and then take the carriage and we had to get out for the ascent and the descent of the high canal embankment. But the moment we entered the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">valley</placeName>, the going was very good. We found <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigall</persName> and <personGrp ref="#Smith">the Smiths</personGrp>, the native <persName ref="">Inspector</persName>, and <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">Maspero</persName> and his Secretary soon arrived. The inner door was ordered down - and while it was being done, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> made a long hot climb to look at a certain site the latter thought favourable - and the rest of us sat on the rocks, or in the carriage from which the horses had been taken. <persName ref="">Mrs. Smith</persName> who was wildly enthusiastic about the whole thing, said that the night had been one of the most beautiful she had ever spent. They felt the cold very much, and got up twice to make tea - and again very early and climbed to one of the highest points to see the sun rise. In half an hour the native Inspector came out of the tomb and said to <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigall</persName> "the entrance is free". He and <persName ref="">Mr. Smith</persName> went down, and in a short time <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Weigall</persName> came up pale and breathless. I thought he had been affected by bad air - but it was only excitement - for he ejaculated "wonderful" "extraordinary" etc. <persName ref="">Mr. Smith</persName> said, "there is everything there but a grand piano., - the place is crowded with furniture and coffins". We waited until <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> were back, when they at once went down and stayed a long time. The tomb was so accessible, opening by its first flight of steps on a level with the pathway - from which a short descending corridor leads to another short stairway, which gives immediate access to the tomb chamber. It lies just between No's 3 and 4 - the former an unfinished tomb intended for <orgName>Ramses III</orgName> - 4 also unfinished - the tomb of <placeName ref="">Ramses XII</placeName>. Neither <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> or <persName ref="#Quibell_James">Quibell</persName> thought<pb n="76"/> this site worth working, but <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> in his thorough way said he should go on clearing up both sides of that side valley - and it was just by this method that he found the tomb of <name>Thothmes IV</name> and Hatshepsut. It is remarkable that this tomb, crowded in between 3 and 4 could have escaped complete spoilation. When these men at last appeared they told us wondrous tales, and allowed us one by one to go down - by the light of candles I could see a dim glitter of gold everywhere and a confusion of coffins and mummies. Arrangements were made at once for bringing electric wires into the tomb, as the <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke">Duke of Connaught</persName> was expected in the afternoon and <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> was very pleased to be able to give him such a sight. Then we all went up to the Thothmes IV plateau, where <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> had lunch for us. Too soon after this <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> started for the tomb again in the hot sun -- and we followed. They went immediately into it - and when in about 20 minutes I saw one rushing up and demanding water and brandy, I knew that <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> must have fainted as he did a few years ago, under exactly the same circumstances. When I reached the first flight of steps, I saw that two people were supporting him at the bottom step, bathing his head and hands. He called up to me however that he was about over it - and was soon able to be helped up - and took refuge in the carriage - and soon seemed none the worse for it. About 4 o'clock, the <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke">Duke</persName> and his party arrived with a military escort - and went down into the tomb. We had withdrawn to a respectful distance and were sitting on the rocks - when the <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke">Duke</persName>, a fine soldierly looking fellow and <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> emerged. The <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke">Duke</persName> strode over the rocks to where <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> was, and heartily congratulated him, and begged to <pb n="77"/> present him to the <orgName>Duchess</orgName>. After they left, <persName ref="#Quibell_James">Mr. Quibell</persName> came very much disgruntled, to find the tomb had been opened in his absence. <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName> discovered by the various inscriptions in the tomb, that it was the burial place of <persName ref="">Yuaa</persName> and <persName ref="">Tuaa</persName>, the father and mother of the great Queen Tyi, wife of <persName ref="">Amenhotep III</persName>. The cartouche of this king is on many of these things - and that of a daughter of his - <persName ref="">Set-amen</persName>. All the objects so far as they have been seen, are in perfect order and good and very beautiful.</placeName>

The tomb was visited today by the <persName ref="#Eugenie_Empress">Ex-Empress Eug&#233;nie</persName>, and also by <persName ref="">Prince Gustave Adolphe</persName> of Sweden. He and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> seem to have struck up quite a friendship. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> was much pleased with him - a sensible, intelligent young fellow. He was very enthusiastic over what he saw, and said, "Moi, Je suis aussi explorer - je fouille dans mon pays - si ca m'arrivera de venir ice pour fouiller comme vous!" One of his aid-de-camps after sent <persName ref="">Mr. Davis</persName> a note thanking him again and again. Also the <persName ref="#Cavendish_Spencer_Duke">Duke</persName> and <persName ref="#Cavendish_Louisa_Duchess">Duchess of Devonshire</persName> saw it.</p>

        <p>A warm, calm day - over to the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley</placeName> again, but I in my donkey chair. I saw the different things found in the tombs well today for the first time - as they had been brought out of the tomb and placed in that of <placeName ref="">Ramses XII</placeName>. The most wonderful and varied collection of beautiful things in perfect condition. The 2 mummies of <orgName>Yuaa</orgName> and <persName ref="">Tuaa</persName>, well preserved and very impressive, despite the fact that <orgName>Tuaa's</orgName> eyes are wide open. They had double coffins of the finest workmanship literally overlaid with gold - chairs, boxes, 3 funeral couches, vases, scarabs, a great roll of papyrus, etc etc. extraordinarily rich - a wonderful find. At 3 o'clock <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> received a note from Capt. <persName ref="">Waters</persName>, which had been sent over from the dahabya, saying their <orgName>Royal Highnesses</orgName> would be glad to come about 5 o'clock to the boat if it would be convenient. So we had to drop everything, order out donkeys, and hurry home the 7 miles. We had just time to wash our faces, and take off our hats, when they arrived, also in riding dress. The <persName ref="">Duke, Duchess</persName>, their daughter<pb n="79"/> Princess <persName ref="">Margaret</persName>, a Lady in Waiting and Capt. Buller. I never met simpler, pleasanter people. They were very much interested in every thing - and it was queer to see them in my room, which they declared lovely. They stayed over an hour, and evidently enjoyed themselves, and parted most fraternally from <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> - Gen. Sir <persName ref="">John Maxwell</persName> was also with them. <personGrp ref="#Maspero">M. and Mme. Maspero</personGrp>, the <persName ref="">Abb&#233;</persName>, called to say goodbye as they start down the river tomorrow. <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> and <persName ref="">Mrs. Amos</persName> also called.</p>

        <p>Starting very early this morning we reached our old mooring place on the sand opposite the <name>Castle</name>, at 8 o'clock. <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel">Luxor</name> looks quite deserted.

We found <personGrp ref="#Campbell">the Campbells</personGrp> here, and they came over to see us at once. <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Mr. Weigall</persName> also came in with many interesting things to say. Quite warm - we all rode over to <placeName ref="">Der el Bahari</placeName> - and had tea with <persName ref="#Ayrton_Edward">Mr. Ayrton</persName> at the little stone house. I saw for the first time the beautiful sarcophagus found by <persName ref="#Naville_Edouard">Naville</persName> on the terrace of the <placeName ref="">Mentuhotep</placeName> temple - of one of the "favourites" of the King - <name>Kau-it</name> - quite exquisite. <persName ref="#Ayrton_Edward">Mr. Ayrton</persName> says there were several graves found.

We stopped at the <placeName ref="#">Ottoman Bank</placeName> a moment as we supposed - and a heavy rain began as <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went in - in a moment or two it had so increased that we sat there in the closed carriage nearly an hour before <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> could come out. I never saw such a down pour - with constant thunder and lightening - as there is little or no drainage in <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, the streets soon became veritable rivers - and when we could start for home, it was like driving along the bed of a river.</p>

        <!--how to tag opera??-->
        <p>We had a perfectly charming ride over here on Thursday afternoon. The country so green and smiling - all the people working in their vineyards and fields - and above all the snowy peaks of the <placeName ref="#Alps">Alps</placeName>, and great masses of dark blue and white clouds about them. It was nice being in <placeName ref="#Milan">Milan</placeName> again, and at this best of hotels, where we are so at home. We are in our old rooms; and found the pretty table ready in our sitting room, with the best dinner we have had in many a month. The next morning we all went to the <placeName ref="#Brera">Brera</placeName>, and after lunch <persName ref="Newberry_Percy">Newberry</persName> went off and <persName ref="#Cigala_Enrique_Martini_di">Cigala</persName> arrived from <placeName ref="#Turin">Turin</placeName>. Yesterday morning we spent at the <placeName ref="#Museo_Poldi_Pezzoli">Paldo-Pezzoli</orgName>. It was good to see our old favourites again. In the afternoon <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName>, <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#Cigala_Enrique_Martini_di">Cigala</persName> and I went to the <placeName ref="#Castello_Sforzesco">Castello</placeName>, which they have been much restoring these past 2 years. It is quite a wonderful place, as building - old fortress, castle etc. They are rebuilding and restoring on exactly the old lines. A store of beautiful things to see, especially the recumbent figure of <persName ref="#Gaston_de_Foix">Caston le Foix</persName> on his tomb by <persName ref="#Agostino_Busti">Bambaja</persName>. Today we went to <placeName ref="#Bergamo">Bergamo</placeName>, in spite of the threatening weather. We took 2 hours going, and the same time coming back, in a veritable omnibus train. We took our lunch with us, and ate it immediately on our arrival just outside the station, under a little arbour covered by Wistaria vines just coming into bloom. Then we went to the <placeName ref="">Motalli</placeName> gallery and while there the storm began. It was impossible to get up to the hill town - and we drove back to the station in a pouring rain, reaching home with thankful hearts in time for tea. The first night of our arrival we went to "<placeName ref="#Teatro_alla_Scala">La Scala</placeName>" to hear<pb n="95"/> <persName ref="#">Don Pasquale</persName> given. We had one of the best loges in the house - the orchestra was immense - the scenery wonderful - but what a performance to call musical - and how strange to discover that so many people live who can take Italian Opera seriously! <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and I went to the back of the box, piled the cushions behind us - and I took a quiet nap. It was 12 o'clock when the ballet began, and as the girls were wild to see it, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and I came home, and sent the carriage back for them. The next night they all went again - but I declined and stayed at home.</p>

Greatly disappointed - but have since heard that<pb n="96"/> no train for <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> had gone out.

        <p>We made a successful journey yesterday from <placeName ref="#Milan">Milan</placeName> - we had a guard of soldiers on our train, there were soldiers in the stations, at the cross-roads, in control of the sentry boxes, switches, tunnels, etc. so that we probably made the safest journey of our lives. The strike is about over - it was never one of wages - but aimed against railway reforms, which the Gov. is instituting - and the Gov. has met the strikers with such prompt measures, that it has collapsed. The rain poured all day - we were an hour and a half late - and found my<pb n="97"/> poor, dear <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> had been waiting nearly two hours.

        <p>Our last 2 days in <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> were very busy - <personGrp ref="">the girls<personGrp> came early - <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I went to the <placeName ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Uffizzi</placeName>, and I saw my favourites - and two charming recent acquisitions "Madonna adoring the <orgName>Infant Christ"</orgName> ascribed to <persName ref="#Lippi_Filippino">Filippino Lippi</persName> - which seems to suggest more the manner of both <persName ref="#Botticelli_Sandro">Botticelli</persName> and <persName ref="#">Fra Lippo Lippi</persName> - and a rare picture by the Umbrian master, <persName ref="#Caporali_Bartolomeo">B. Caporali</persName>, a Holy Family - with background in gold, and lovely colouring and expression. The new Director <persName ref="#Ricci_Corrado">Ricci</persName>, who has done such good work in <placeName ref="#Milan">Milan</placeName> and other cities in reorganizing and rearranging the picture galleries, is now engaged in evolving order and sequence into the long neglected <placeName ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Uffizi</placeName> - and it already shows marked improvement. We walked about the corridors, and looked at the views from those lofty windows, as well as the pictures, and went out on the great roof of the <placeName ref="#Loggia_dei_Lanzi">Loggia dei Longi</placeName>, which is going to be made into a kind of roof garden. We found ourselves almost on a level with the <placeName ref="#Palazzo_Vecchio">Palazzo Vecchio</placeName> tower, and just under it. Then we walked through the gallery to the <placeName ref="#Palazzo_Pitti">Pitti</placeName>, and so home. In the afternoon <persName ref="#Smith_Harold">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="">Ream</persName> came to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Westminster">Hotel</name>, and we all<pb n="101"/> drove to the <placeName ref="">Villino</placeName> for tea. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> and I stayed to dinner - and we hated to come away and say goodbye to the sweet little house. Saturday dawned cold and stormy - we had the carriage and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> went with me to the bank - and to the English Bakery to get some things for our tea basket on the train. <persName ref="#Buttles_Lizzie">Lizzie</persName> and <personGrp ref="">the girls<personGrp> to lunch - and the latter went in the omnibus with us to the station. <persName ref="#Burton_Harry">Harry Surton</persName> came also. We had a very comfortable journey here - two compartments in the train-de-luxe - one <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> and <persName ref="#Amelie">Amelie</persName> occupied - and the other I had to myself, a connecting door made them pleasant. I did not pull down the blinds of my windows - so that the dawn wakened me - and I piled my pillows and sat up in bed to see the dawn come upon the snow covered peaks - a lovely scenery all day - until as we drew near <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> the rain began - and was pouring when we arrived. Found <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> installed in our old quarters, with a bright fire - and after dinner we sat talking late. Today has been cold, cloudy and damp. We have been busy - as we have only 5 days here.</p>

        <p>Our journey over from <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> the other day was a really pleasant<pb n="102"/> one. <persName ref="#Busk_Daisy">Daisy Busk</persName> came with us. They sail on the 20th. The weather was good - the channel boat "<name type="boat" ref="#le_Nord">Le Nord</name>" was big and comfortable. The 3 girls stayed on deck and enjoyed it. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and I took possession of the cabin de luxe, he took one sofa and I the other and slept all the way over. We had an enormous number of passengers, as the <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName> train was just in, and such an amount of luggage, that we were 2 hours late leaving <placeName ref="#Dover">Dover</placeName>. It was nice to be in <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName> once more. We reached our hotel of last year, <name type="hotel" ref="#Buckland_Manor_Hotel">Bucklands</name>, in time for dinner which was served in our large pleasant sitting room. <persName ref="#Fielding_Everard">Everard Fielding</persName> came in the evening, as pleasant as ever, and looking very well. Monday the racket began. <personGrp ref="">the girls<personGrp> and I went to <persName ref="#">Nicolls</persName>, and ordered our tailor gowns. In the afternoon we all went to the wonderful <placeName ref="#Wallace_Collection">Wallace Collection</placeName>, and came home really tired. <persName ref="#Newberry_Percy">Mr. Newberry</persName> dined with us and we had a nice evening. We find <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Mr. Carter</persName> has gone out to <persName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</persName>, and <persName ref="#Newberry_Percy">Newberry</persName> goes himself in June. Tuesday we spent the whole of the morning at the <placeName ref="#South_Kensington_Museum">South Kensington Museum</placeName> - and came home more dead than alive. Poor <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> had such a headache that she had to take to her bed, where she stayed. Such a disappointment too, as <persName ref="#Fielding_Everard">Fielding</persName> was dining here, and we were going to the <placeName ref="#Royal_Court_Theater">Court Theatre</placeName> to hear one of <persName ref="#Shaw_George_Bernard">Bernard Shaw</persName>'s plays - John Bulls other Island". It was admirably done, and very amusing. Wednesday <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> was all right again - we were driving all the morning - very bright weather, but cold, gusty winds. Mr. <persName ref="">Newberry</persName> came to lunch, and after <persName ref="#Rathbone_Mr">Mr. Rathbone</persName>, bringing me most lovely roses. In, all the afternoon. Today we have been shopping and driving, lunched with <persName ref="#Farrer_William_Sir">Sir WIlliam Farrer</persName> - he looking so well - and so bright<pb n="103"/> and charming - but grown quite deaf. <persName ref="#">Col.

Soon after we got home, and were comforting ourselves with hot tea, Mr. <persName ref="">Rathbone</persName> called, and made one of his charming visits. <persName ref="">Theo</persName> brought <persName ref="">Fielding</persName> back to dinner, and they are now looking at the <orgName>Egyptian</orgName> photos.</p>

        <p>I went to the <name>First Church of Christian Science</name> this morning in <placeName ref="">Sloam Terrace</placeName> and found the same large reverent congregation that I found there last year. it is really bitterly cold today.

There were also "Percy <orgName>Granger"</orgName> a clever rising musical pianist and two lesser lights - and they gave us some lovely music after dinner.

A wonderful performance - the setting so fine and perfect - <persName ref="">Irving</persName> looks very old - and received a real ovation.
