          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</name> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the <orgName ref="#'Golden_Age'">'Golden Age'</orgName> of <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</name> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <name ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington.</name> <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B.

            <p>We reached <placeName ref="#Port_Said">Port Said</placeName> Saturday at midnight - the usual fracas and disagreeable features of coaling all night. Ports, doors, everything closed - noise etc. - to my thinking there is nothing gained by going on to <placeName ref="#Ismailia">Ismailia</placeName> - better solve the unpleasant problem by quitting the steamer at any hour she arrives, and accepting anything that can be found at <placeName ref="#Port_Said">Port Said</placeName>. As it was, we slept little were very slow in getting through the canal next day, sticking several times, and did not reach <placeName ref="#Ismailia">Ismailia</placeName> until 7:30 - waited some time for the tender, and did not land before 9:30 - a passable supper - and bed rooms - <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and <pb n="137"> I in one room - my bed so chill and damp, that I have suffered much from it - we reached <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> at 6 P.M. and were soon installed in our old corner rooms to the north - feeling very much at home. We drove down to the boat this morning - finding her almost in sailing condition. There remain however, all the stores to be unpacked, and a thousand little things to be arranged and settled.</p>

            <p>At last we are settled in this our delightful little winter home - and it would be entirely perfect had I only my dear <persName>Toby</persName> here! How glad I am to quit all that entourage at <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepheards_Hotel">Shepheards</name>, I cannot even express to myself! I have had 10 days of real illness - several days in my bed. In all my life I have never been so ill - the winter is a bad one in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - cold - high winds - and little sunshine. We kept a steady fire in our sitting room. Everyone has a cold. <persName ref="#Bend_Mrs">Mrs. Bend</persName> and <persName ref="#Norman_Mrs">Mrs. Norman</persName> half the time in their beds. We found our faithful <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed Salah</persName> waiting for us at the station when we arrived, and <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName> and <persName ref="#Ibrahim">Ibrahim</persName>. We had our Xmas this morning, and gave the men all around, shawls and knives and cigarettes - good woolen underclothes for <persName ref="#Fuli_Rais">Rais Fuli</persName>, <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName>, <persName ref="#">Mattar</persName>, and <persName ref="#Ibrahim">Ibrahim</persName>. <persName>Theodore</persName> had bought for <persName>Rais Fuli</persName> in <placeName>Paris</placeName> last spring a first class field glass - and has his name put in gilt letters on the case - and I had extra things for <persName>Abdul, Mattar</persName> and <persName>Ibrahim.</persName> The men had - sheep - and I went into town this afternoon <orgName>PAGE 138</orgName> to find all the shops closed. Last evening being Christmas night, <persName>Mrs. Bend</persName> and the girls dined with us. The first dinner of our new cook - and a very good dinner it was - quite admirable - they were quite impressed.</p>

            <p><persName>Monty</persName> and I paid a hurried visit to <placeName>Hatoun's</placeName> and <placeName>Parvis's</placeName> shops this morning, and hurried back - we got off at 12:30 in a very good wind and reached <placeName>Bedrashein</placeName> in less than 3 hours - have dawdelled away much time in fear of our big sail, which proves too big. <persName>Theodore</persName> has decided to have it made smaller tomorrow, and to kill two birds with one stone by visiting <placeName>Sakkarah,</placeName> which we did not intend doing until we come down - as I am not now very fit. So <persName>Rais Fuli</persName> took the 6 o'clock train to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to fetch the sail makers. Cold.</p>

            <p>They all made an early start for <persName>Sakkarah</persName> this morning - even <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName>Amilie.</persName> I sent <persName>Amilie</persName> as she had never seen it. They all condoled with me on going off, because I was to be left all alone for the day. But after they got away, I smiled and began to enjoy myself! I mended 2 sponge bags - I explored the little store closet under the stairs, arranged and consensed it - put in order the linen closet and my dress closet, re-arranged <persName>Abdul's</persName> sideboard for him - the bookcase and all the small things - and after a delicious little lunch, with <persName>Abdul</persName> waiting upon me so quietly and faithfully, I took a book and stretch myself upon the divan in the saloon - where I could neither read or sleep PAGE 139 because of enjoying the delicious quiet and repose. The first quiet day I have had for almost a year! I enjoyed the occasional bursts of sunshine through the window, across the mossy green carpet, and the big green chair, making a delicate harmony with the line of young wheat growing on the bank - and the palms tossing their branches above. The <persName>Rameses</persName> came up from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> - on which are <personGrp ref="#Whitehead">Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead</personGrp> - and <persName>Mr. W.</persName> came over to make me a little visit - reporting <persName ref="#Whitehead_Mrs">Mrs. W</persName>. afraid to venture out in the cold, and only 35 passengers. I asked him why he had not gone to see wonderful <persName>Sakkarah,</persName> and he said "he thought he would get enough of temples and pyramids before he got out of <orgName>Egypt"!</orgName> Our people came back about 5, raving about their delicious day. We find our little stoves most comfortable and cheerful - we could hardly exist without them. All day long, the big sail has been stretched on shore, with the men ripping and cutting - now she is pronounced to be all right and is again in place on the boom. Every inch of the boat outside and in, was painted last summer, in admirable fashion, making a great improvement in the Beduin. I never saw more beautiful paint - the tints so perfect - and the finish like porcelain. We seem now to be quite perfect.</p>

            <p>The day began cold, with a south wind which changed to north about one o'clock - and we sailed away until 4 P.M. when it veered to west, and we tied up, after having made 8 miles - the sail proves quite perfect. PAGE 140</p>

            <p>>We made an early start this morning before 7 - the wind good and strengthening all the time - at 1 o'clock we were driven on a sand bank - but pulled to the anchor and got away and sailed finely until about 6 P.M. when we stopped for the night near <placeName>Wasta,</placeName> having made about 33 miles - very cold and windy.

            <p>We have been sitting about since dinner, talking and reading. I have been reading aloud in <placeName>Sayce's</placeName> "Egypt of the <placeName>Hebrews"</placeName> then <persName>Theodore</persName> read from "In Memoriam". It is very still and quiet - not a sound to be heard outside - the men all asleep - not a sound - and I intend as I always do, to see the old year out. It is cold - but no wind - we had a great surprise this morning. I knew it was very cold, and <persName>Jones</persName> had come into my room and lighted my little stove, which made a cheerful light in my darkened room, it being hardly past 7 o'clock - when I heard <persName>Monty</persName> asking if he could come in, that he had something to show me. So in he came, wrapped in his bathrobe with his hat on, and a little tray in his hand on which was heaped a little pile of snow, or more strictly speaking frost! He said the decks were white with it - that there was a dense fog, and the extreme cold had turned it to snow, wherever it touched. All the men were tremendously impressed - only one or two every having seen anything of the kind before. PAGE 141 It took the sun a long time to dissipate the fog - but at last the clearest and brightest day we have had since we came, evolved itself - and after a general cleaning and rubbing and drying of the decks, we sailed away in a very light wind which continued until nearly 8 o'clock - when we tied up. I have been on deck most of the time - air so delicious -dry - and with a real snap of cold in it. We have made about 12 miles.</p>

            <p>The <orgName>New Year</orgName> dawned cold and dark - when I first looked out of my window, the river was as smooth as a mirror, and the clouds looked like snow. It was not until after 9 o'clock that the sun came out, and shown fitfully and dimly. The wind too was fitful - however we sailed as we could until nearly 7 o'clock - the moon being half full.

We sailed splendidly without a break until 6 o'clock or thereabouts, making 55-1/2 miles. The air was softer, and the sun bright, the afternoon delicious. I was on deck from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>

The steamer <name>Tewfik,</name> with Mr. <persName>Cornelius Vanderbilt</persName> passed up - giving us a salute as he passed. We tracked later, for about a mile to a good place for the night.

            <p>A cold day - the morning very quiet until nearly noon, when we pulled up our stakes and started among the crowd of working boats, only to find we had left one of our sailors on shore, who had been sent to find some vegetables. An exciting time for a few moments, when we finally got under way with a fair wind increasing to strong - and we did some splendid and difficult sailing - it was like yachting. We saw the minarets of <placeName>Assiut</placeName> all the afternoon appear and disappear - but as usual seemed to get no nearer to them. After we tied up, the wind began to blow, and rain poured smartly for half an hour. The sailors made a great row on deck, getting the furniture together and covered and the awnings up. Made 18 miles.</p>

            <p>A beautiful day - almost warm - and almost like Egypt. Light winds and some tracking brought us early in the afternoon to Assiut. The <orgName>Nitassis</orgName> passed down. Got a big mail of papers and letters - and had, for the first time some positive information in regard to the sudden move of troops from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to the <orgName>Sudan.</orgName> It was at first reported that the emergency was so great, that most of <orgName>Cook's</orgName> steamers would be required, as he has the contract with Government to carry troops - but it seems that was an exaggeration. They go by rail to <placeName>Nag Hamadi,</placeName> and then are shipped. An officer told <persName>Theodore</persName> today, that the finishing of the railway between <placeName>Nag Hamadi</placeName> and <placeName>Assouan,</placeName> was to be pushed on to rapid finish. <persName>Nettie</persName> and I took a drive into <placeName>Assiut</placeName> this afternoon. A <orgName>PAGE 144</orgName> very large and growing town - especially the <orgName>European</orgName> quarter - near the river, and <name>American Mission College.</name> We waited some time at the gate of a garden, where <persName>Abdul,</persName> and a kind of rais belonging to the carriage, a mere bundle of rags, with a smiling yellow face above, who seemed to be the elder brother of the two wretched little horses, went to get me some flowers. We thought we had never seen so many varieties of humanity as passed and repassed continually - with many it would have been hard from appearance to have drawn the line between the beast and the human. The <orgName>Ramesis the Third</orgName> came to the landing near us, and a small <orgName>Gage</orgName> steamer, with Prince <persName>Henri de Bourbon</persName> and party on board. We are having splendid nights - the moon just full. Made 10 miles today.</p>

            <p>Still here - having devoted the day to a general cleaning - to getting something done to our oven - to doing a big wash - <persName>Nettie</persName> and I took another drive this morning - into the town, and making the circuit of it. It is a holiday - being the 8th anniversary of the accession of the <orgName>Khodive.</orgName> The town was therefore crowded - and we drove through solid masses of turbaned humanity. We had no one with us but our driver - but we did not meet with the slightess rudeness - though it was as well perhaps that we did not understand all that was said to us. The moon makes such beauty, rising above the splendid palm and scent groves, that line the shore of the river opposite <placeName>Assiut.</placeName> PAGE 145</p>

            <p>We have had the warmest day of the year - and a very still one too - but have made <persName>Aboutig</persName> where we are not lying, 15 miles from <placeName>Assiut</placeName> - <persName>Theodore</persName> and <persName>Monty</persName> walked into the town, although it was almost dark when we tied up - and said it seemed very clean and charming. It always looks inviting, with its 2 handsome twin minarets showing above the trees. Made 15 miles.</p>

            <p>We had slipped along under light winds today, until we are within a short distance of <placeName>Tahtah,</placeName> and suppose we have made 25 miles. Warmer - and splendid moonlight nights.</p>

            <p>We are lying at <placeName>Sohag</placeName> - after a fine day of difficult sailing - beginning about 10 o'clock. Very difficult bends of the river - we turn and turn upon our path - made 28 miles. <placeName>Sohag</placeName> is on a hight bank with its handsome river front with its very good houses; looks quite unique for Egypt. We will wait here for the man who has been sent up from <placeName>Cairo,</placeName> with the new wash bowl for my room.</p>

            <p>We came the 5 miles from <placeName>Sohag</placeName> this afternoon, having waited all day for the plumber to finish his work in my room. We went for a <orgName>PAGE 146</orgName> walk after breakfast, and seeing a little dahabeah flying the <orgName>American</orgName> flag, and hearing from one of our sailors that it was a "Hakim", we thought it might be some of the people of the <orgName>American Mission School,</orgName> as we know they sometimes go out in this way - and wishing much to talk to them, we went down to call. But we found the <persName>"Hakim"</persName> was a dentist with a very <orgName>Hebrew</orgName> name, and his card bore the title of dentist to the <orgName>Khodive.</orgName> <persName>Theodore,</persName> asked him if he would like to see our boat, thereupon he came, bringing with him a most respectable citizen of <persName>Sohag,</persName> who he introduced as one of the "old <orgName>Egyptian</orgName> nobles" - whatever that might be. He then asked if he could bring the <placeName>Mudir</placeName> of the district in the afternoon - and about 3 o'clock they came, in some state. The <persName>Mudir</persName> was very well dressed in <orgName>European</orgName> fashion - and spoke admirable <orgName>English</orgName> - had a pleasant polished manner - and seemed much interested in the boat.</p>

            <p>A fine warm day - wind light - reached this place at 4 o'clock - found the <persName>R.R.</persName> bridge closed - and after pulling up, heard that it would not open again today. <persName>Theodore</persName> and the rest went for a walk - and met and talked with the Engineer of the bridge - an <orgName>Englishman</orgName> - who PAGE 147 said it was entirely in the hands of the Government lately - as trains were running all the times, carrying troops to <placeName>Assouan</placeName> and the front. They saw a large barge with horses, and about 5 camels, and ammunition cars, waiting for the <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> regiment that comes up tomorrow. The bridge opens at 6 in the morning, and we hope to get through at once. Made 18 miles.</p>

            <p>Got through the bridge this morning at 8 o'clock by towing - arrangements there very good. A strong north wind was too much for us, and we had to stop sailing long before noon, and tied up to the bank. About half past 5 we started and slowly moved along in a light wind for 2 miles, when we stopped - judging we had made ruing the day 10 miles.</p>

            <p>Started early - light wind and tracking made <persName>Denderah</persName> at noon. The day warm and delicious. <persName>Rode</persName> out to the <placeName>Temple</placeName> after lunch. My new saddle a great success. We had excellent donkeys and enjoyed the ride immensely. <name>Flinders Petrie</name> is excavating near <placeName>Denderah.</placeName> We could see PAGE 148 the dust of the excavations - and the comfortable looking house he has built there. As we reached the river again, we saw the <persName>Isis</persName> with an <orgName>English</orgName> flag passing - and a few moments after, the <persName>Alma</persName> appeared, and we are lying just behind her tonight 5 miles above Keneh.</p>

            <p>We reached <placeName>Luxor</placeName> at 6:30 this evening, having made a fine run of 44 miles. A rather exciting day too, as the <persName>Isis</persName> was just ahead, the <persName>Alma</persName> at our heels, and the <orgName>Gazelle</orgName> behind her. The wind was so light, it was hardly a zephyr and we stole along by the town like a ghost - and came into our old place just under the <placeName>Castle.</placeName></p>

            <p>We have a very good plan to lie - in a little cove just under the Castle - where no one can pull in ahead of us. The Alma lies, above, around the corner - and the <orgName>Gazelle</orgName> behind us. The <name>Zenet-el Nil,</name> with her owner <persName>M. Goliniescheff,</persName> the <name>Hyksos,</name> with the <orgName>Shephards</orgName> - and the <orgName>Gamilla</orgName> flying the <orgName>German</orgName> flag, are in port. <placeName>Luxor</placeName> looks cold, and quiet <persName>Achmed</persName> was waiting with his donkeys this morning, and we had just started, when we met <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Whitehead</persName> who are on the <placeName>Ramesis,</placeName> walking down to see us. Se we dismounted and walked back with them - as Mrs. <persName>W.</persName> had not seen the boat, and they were to leave for <placeName>Cairo,</placeName> at noon. Then we walked back to the <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> with them - there mounted our donkeys, <persName>Theodore</persName> and I, as <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName>Monty</persName> were visiting the <orgName>Luxor PAGE 149</orgName> temple. We rode out towards <placeName>Karnak,</placeName> but it was too late to visit the temples, and stopping for a moment at the <placeName>Hotel,</placeName> we got home just in time for lunch. I stayed at home in the afternoon - enjoying our delightful deck, and the matchless and unique view across the stretch of the river, and the plain beyond, of the mountains. All day, the river has been so smooth, that the mountains with their soft, yellow pink have been reflected in it. Mr. <persName>James Stokes</persName> called late in the afternoon. He is one of the unfortunate passengers on the <orgName>Rameses the Great</orgName> who were unexpectedly disembarked here for several days, while the steamer was ordered forward to pull off some barges aground, full of stores and ammunition for the army, and to tow them to <placeName>Assouan.</placeName></p>

            <p>This afternoon we all went to the <orgName>Races</orgName> - which were sufficiently amusing - saw the <orgName>Vanderbilts</orgName> who are here on their steamer the "Tewfik" and met unexpectedly <persName>Florence Taylor</persName> - who with her mother are up the river with the <orgName>Thubrons</orgName> in the <orgName>Indiana,</orgName> of the <orgName>Anglo-American</orgName> line. They ( the <persName>Taylors)</persName> came afterwards to the boat, with Sir <persName>John Scott,</persName> and we asked Mrs. <persName>T.</persName> and <placeName>Florence</placeName> to come back and dine with us - which they did, we sending the felucca for them. They were enchanted with our excellent dinner, poor starved things - a merry evening. They said for <placeName>Nice,</placeName> Feb. 12.</p>

A beautiful sail all the afternoon - part of the time in a crowd of gyassas, laden rails for the railway in the south - some of them with cattle.

It has been warmer today, and is milder tonight. I have been on deck most of the day - such lovely colouring - and a sunset of of every colour of the rainbow - etherially delicate. Our moon is PAGE 153 now well on in her second quarter. The thermometer on my balcony this morning registered 36&#8304;.</p>

            <p>Started about 8 o'clock, and sailed splendidly all day - arriving at 4;30. The river was so full of gyssas, all laden with railway materials and army supplies, that the sailing was exciting. Found <persName>Assouan</persName> so crowded with the same, and all the quay near the <placeName>R.R.</placeName> station given up to unloading - even <persName>Cook's</persName> landing stage has been moved down by the barracks to avoid the noise and bustle. We did not know at first where we could land - but at last feeling our way along <placeName>Elephantine,</placeName> we passed the <orgName>Alma,</orgName> and then the <orgName>Pocahantus</orgName> - and pulled in behind the <persName>Zenet-el-Nil,</persName> at the very beginning of the little sand gesireh - which is now indeed a very considerable island, so low is the river. However the bank is green with young wheat, and splendid palms above - and we congratulated ourselves, in spite of the fact that the <persName>Osiris</persName> lies beyond the <orgName>Zenet</orgName> - - then a great crowd of gyassas - then the <orgName>Isis</orgName> and <name>Gazelle</name> and then the Istar.

Then to the Hotel to read the dispatches - I have never seen <persName>Assouan</persName> so busy - such crowds of boats, and business of unloading - such extraordinary crowds - much black, black faces. The long, well built quay now is really handsome - and many good new buildings. What a change from 10 years ago! To the <placeName>Grenfell</placeName> tombs - I waiting for the rest to clamber up and down, in the felucca with my book.</p>

So when the felucca came back from the other side, we went to the <orgName>Istar</orgName> - and had a pleasant visit -tea on deck - then down stairs to see his room, old fashioned boat - 22 ft. wide - while we are only 17-1/2. His saloon furnished in yellow brocatelle seemed enormous. We saw some good antiquities - and he showed us in the <orgName>French Expedition</orgName> book, the pictures of the temples on <placeName>Elephantine,</placeName> which were destroyed by <persName>Mohamet Ali</persName> to build a palace across the river, of which now no fragments remain.

The <orgName>PAGE 155</orgName> station is rather difficult to get to now, so encumbered is all the territory around with military stores - and with railway materials waiting shipment for the <orgName>Soudan.</orgName> A jolting, rattling three quarters of an hour brought us to <placeName>Shellal</placeName> - where there is a military encampment and more supplies - and steamers and barges for shipping them. I found <persName>Little Yemma</persName> waiting at the <placeName>Philae</placeName> landing - and he soon produced the delightful little <persName>Dendowi,</persName> not much changed or grown. Found <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Newman</persName> in the long colannade - he painting as usual, and looking very well, both very kind and hospitable, and asked us down to their boat for coffee, and to see his <orgName>Japanese</orgName> sketches. After luncheon <persName>Theodore</persName> and I went down - and spent a very pleasant hour. Home in a cataract boat, bring <persName>Miss Broderick</persName> and <persName>Miss Dickson</persName> with us. It was more exciting this descent than I have ever known it. I suppose because the water is lower than usual.</p>

            <p>Very warm all day - and tired with my expedition of yesterday I stayed at home all day. The rest went off late in the afternoon for a row around the island, and came home complaining of the heat. <persName>Nettie</persName> and I went to dine with <persName>Miss Broderick</persName> on the <placeName>Alma</placeName> - and had a charming evening - with much music. <persName>Miss Kilburn</persName> playing the violin admirable. The row down to their boat, and back again to ours in the wonderful moon-light was delightful. PAGE 156 (not numbered)</p>

            <p>At home all day until the afternoon, when I went with the rest in the felucca in the mountain of the <orgName>Coptic Dor.</orgName> I sat in the boat with my book, while the rest climbed through the hot sand, and found the ruined convent very interesting. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> dined with us. He starts down tomorrow.</p>

            <p>It was so warm this morning that we none of us felt energetic and <persName>Theodore</persName> proposed that we should sail up to the cataract, and get out on one of the islands. It was not much of a sail, as there was so little wind. But on coming to the first rapid water, we stopped at the nearest island of rock and sand, and walked about on the clean, hard sand, rifted over and over by the wind - and broken by huge masses of lovely rose granite. The <orgName>Istar</orgName> and the <persName>Zenet el-Nil</persName> started down that afternoon.</p>

            <p>Warm and delightful all day. Did nothing. All the <persName>Alma</persName> people came to dine - and after dinner we went on deck to enjoy the wonderful moonlight. <persName>Theodore</persName> is growing anxious to get down the river, and talks of going on Thursday or Friday.</p>

            <p>The first thing <persName>Theodore</persName> asked me as he came into breakfast this morning was "do you mind starting down today". I said "no", though I am always reluctant to leave <persName>Assouan.</persName> So after breakfast we crossed in the felucca to get our mail, pay a last visit to the bazaar, and send some telegrams, when we got back, we found the awnings being taken down and general preparations for the start. I wrote a hurried note to <persName>Miss Broderick,</persName> explaining our sudden change of plan - knowing that they had all gone to <placeName>Philae</placeName> for the day. At 12;30 we were off, and a light south wind springing up we came along right merrily - when the wind failed - the head has been intense - 95&#8304; on my back balcony - but that has some reflection. Pulled up at 7 o'clock just as a sudden, howling wind came up and made our landing very difficult. Suppose we are about 5 miles from <placeName>Kom Ombo.</placeName> The air is so charged with sand that the moon can just be seen, wan and almost green - and she has lost a little slice off her. Very warm tonight.</p>

            <p>We have only succeeded in making 2 miles today - when the <placeName>N.W.</placeName> wind increased so much we were forced to tie up, where we now lie. Since early this morning the same thick dust laden air of last evening - the sun showing dimly through it, like a pale full moon. Walking has been impossible - and we have stayed in doors.</p>

            <p>We came down the 3 miles to <placeName>Kom Ombo</placeName> where we now are. I wakened at 5 this morning, and found we were under way. After breakfast we went up to the temple, and spent two pleasant hours there - in PAGE 158 spite of high wind and the dust of the excavators outside the temple wall. While we were there the "Horus" came up with a tug, flying the <orgName>English</orgName> flag, and pulled up ahead of us. The views from the temple plateau are so splendid, I never want to come away. While we were sitting at lunch the "Cheops" appeared with tug, and <orgName>English</orgName> flag - but did not stop - and soon after the "Philetus" came sailing up, also with the <orgName>English</orgName> flag - and stopped, and next appeared the "Miriam" the <placeName>Egyptian Museum</placeName> boat, with a tug, and stopped behind us - so that the settlement is a large one tonight. We had had a pleasant scheme for taking tea in the temple this afternoon - but the high wind, and all the people from the boats made it impossible.</p>

            <p>Started early this morning, and at 12 o'clock made Silsilis. Tremendous wind - with some difficulty made a landing on the <placeName>West</placeName> bank, and visited the different little shrines and Specs. Then got away, but <orgName>PAGE 159</orgName> were nearly blown upon the rocks, which make this part of the river dangerous - and dropped our anchor just in time to save us.

            <p>Began rowing at 6 o'clock - I looked out of my window, and saw a smooth water, a rosy, golden flush of dawn, and a waning moon high in the sky, reflected in the water. Brought up at <placeName>Edfou</placeName> at 8 o'clock - and found the <placeName>Mena</placeName> (Cook's boat) with Col. <persName>John Hay,</persName> our Minister at <persName>London,</persName> and his party - and 2 other boats. Started soon after breakfast for the temple - where we stayed about 2 hours, and were back before lunch and off, and have been floating with a little rowing all day until 6:30 when we stopped.

            <p>Reached <placeName>El-Kab</placeName> at 8 o'clock - found the <placeName>Istar</placeName> lying in front of the <placeName>Antah</placeName> - and while we were seated at breakfast, Mr. <persName>Somers-Clarke</persName> came in to see us, and to ask us to come to his boat to see the <orgName>Sacred Hawk</orgName> he had found at <placeName>Kom</placeName> el-Akmar. After breakfast I mounted a donkey, while the rest walked, into the old fortress and amongst its ruins, and then climbed the great wall 30 ft. or more thick, and I dismounted and walked on it - a rare view of desert, and river, and remains of former human habitation. Then we went to the <name>Antar</name> and saw the head and crown of the splendid hawk - as large as a big apple, of pure gold with a crown of gold 6 in. high, representing the <orgName>Osiris</orgName> feather crown - with eyes of obsidian - the workmanship fine and spirited. The body which we did not see, is of bronze, and much broken, but can be reconstructed. Then we were shown in the portico of the little house on shore, what is more interesting historically, a kneeling figure in stone, very crude and archaic, what Mr. <persName>S.-C.</persName> thinks belongs to the prehistoric time - also found at <placeName>Kom El-Ahmar,</placeName> where Mr. <placeName>Quibell</placeName> is excavating. In the afternoon we all rode out to the little temple of <placeName>Amenophis III</placeName> in the desert and had tea - we had never seen this pretty and interesting temple which Mr. <persName>S.-C.</persName> has illustrated and described. The ride through the desert valley - with the great arid mountains around us, and the evening colours, was something to remember. Evidences of the water courses, which are sometimes fed by the rains in the mountains were interesting. Mr. <persName>Sayce,</persName> and Mr. <persName>S.-C.</persName> came to dinner - a pleasant evening - talked over the <name>Egypt Exploration Fund</name> Society. PAGE 161</p>

            <p>Arrived at <placeName ref="#Balyana_Al">Balliana</placeName> about 9:30 - found the <name type="boat" ref="#Olga">Olga</name> and the <name type="boat" ref="#Alma">Alma</name> lying near each other. All their people had gone out to <placeName ref="#Abydos">Abydos,</placeName> and except <persName ref="#Broderick_Miss">Miss Broderick</persName> - who came over at once to see us. We started ourselves in half an hour - the morning being cool and cloudy - and although the 2 hours ride out there even with the worst donkeys in the world, was delightful over that wide cultivated country - the wheat quite grown and bearded - oats well formed, and the air full of blossoming clover - yet the coming home was tiring in the extreme - bad donkey boys, unpleasant, natives, and intolerable donkeys, almost spoiled the lovely face of nature. We could not go to the tomb of <placeName>Osiris</placeName> as no one could tell us where it was. We have been baking bread today for the crew - and get off early tomorrow. <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name>, <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">Mimi</name>, and <name type="boat" ref="#Nephtys">Nephtys</name> all here.</p>

            <p>Began rowing at 5:30 - at 9 o'clock the north wind was so strong we gave it up and went to shore. It blew a gale until 7 o'clock when we dropped down 3 miles to <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Girgeh</placeName> - having made altogether the 8 miles between the two places.

            <p>An exasperating day. We started early and rowed around the two great turns between <placeName ref="#Manfalût">Manfalout</placeName> and half way past the <placeName ref="#Abu_Fudah_Jabal">Gebel Abou Feydah</placeName> chain - and were congratulating ourselves that we were going to pass it, when the north wind became so strong, we had to stop before making the last turn - as these dangerous cliffs come down quite to the<pb n="168"/> water - and here we are still, with the lights of another dahabeah showing a little above us - we do not know what. Every night now we have 3 or 4 <persName>Gaffirs</persName> or guards watching us - as this part of the river always has a bad reputation - and there is much excitement now over the sad murder a short time since at <placeName ref="#Maghaghah">Maghagah</placeName> of <placeName>Lord Cowper</placeName>'s valet, who left the dahabeah for the <orgName>Post Ofice</orgName>, and missing his way back, was decoyed it is supposed into the sugar cane. His body was found the same evening robbed - and he had been strangled after a violent struggle. This has made a great stir - especially as two murders of natives in the same vicinity have since taken place. The <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">"Mimi"</name> passed us this afternoon in tow of a tug. Made about 8 miles.</p>

            <p>In spite of the wind, we have come bravely along today - and are now just by <placeName>Melawi-el-Arieh</placeName>, having made 25 miles. This morning before 7 o'clock the <name type="boat" ref="#Herodotus_Boat">Herodotus</name> in tow passed down - and about 11 o'clock this morning we came upon her sticking tight in the sand. She must have been there a long time and we were just preparing to offer assistance, when she began to start. Too windy to be on deck today until about 4 o'clock when I went up - and we had tea there - and a beautiful sail, or row until dark - passing the end of the <placeName>Abu Feydah</placeName> chain - with a lovely bank of palm trees - villages - fields - cattle, sheep and the evening air of repose over all. There is a dahabeah just behind us, but too far for us to make her out. She is probably the <name type="boat" ref="#Alma">Alma.</name> <pb n="169"/></p>

            <p>Early this morning I was wakened by hearing <persName>Jones</persName> saying to <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> in the hall that we were passing the <name type="boat" ref="#Olga">Olga</name> stuck in the sand, and raising my curtain I saw her plainly - her stern right in the bank and slightly tilted. None of the family visible - and she had the air of having adapted herself to the situation. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> sent word to ask if we could help her - but it seems she had been there for more than a day, and there was nothing but a tug - so after stopping a moment we came on. The <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">Mimi</name> passed us in tow later on - and we floated and rowed making <persName>Pinieh</persName> at 6:30, where we stopped for mail. Made 31-1/2 miles.</p>

The river has been very difficult today in several places - we were on the sand for a few minutes - and I cannot imagine how the boats we left behind us can get through - as even we with our light draught find it so difficult.

            <p>Made about 8 miles this morning and got as far as <placeName ref="#Biba">Bibeh</placeName>, when the north wind was so strong we had to drop our anchor to save ourselves <pb n="170"/>from being sent on to the rocky cliffs - and we have not moved since, except as the wind has swayed us. The ominous sky brought the storm just as we had finished dinner. It blew tremendously, and the rain fell in torrents. The boat proved very tight, the only leaks being in my room, where the roof is higher - and at this offset there were several leaks - and towels, cups and bowls were put in requisition. I took a volume of <orgName>McMasters History of the People</orgName> of the <placeName>United States</placeName> from the bookcases this evening, and chanced upon the interesting and pathetic history of the settlement of <placeName>Galliopolis</placeName> in <placeName>Ohio</placeName> - which I had never read before.</p>

            <p>I did not get to bed last night until nearly one o'clock. The storm which seemed to pass away in the evening, burst upon us again after eleven. All the family had gone to bed - so <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I stayed up and again put in use the bowls, cups, and towels. For the first time, I really felt a little afraid as we were lying in the middle of the river - we had 3 anchors down, and the boat tugged at them most unpleasantly. Early this morning we pulled to the anchor to a safer place, and put out our 3 anchors on a little sand island, where we are still lying, the wind having blown great guns all day. The <name type="boat">Ramses</name> passed us early - feeling her way very cautiously indeed. I went on deck for a few moments after tea - but it was too windy to be pleasant - though the air was soft and deliciously full of the fragrance of clover blossoms. Wrote my Sunday letter to <persName ref="#Titus_Mrs">Mrs. Titus</persName> - and one to <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Jennie Buttles</persName> in <placeName>Gambier.</placeName> <pb n="171"/></p>

            <p>We have had the most exciting day I ever passed o the <placeName ref="Nile">Nile</placeName>. We began the day early, with a light south wind - and found the river very difficult. About 10 o'clock we descried a Cook Steamer evidently stuck on the sand, ahead of us - and on coming up with her found her to be the <name type="boat" ref="#Ammartis">Ammartis,</name> which passed us yesterday. She was surrounded by gyasses, who were relieving her of some of her luggage. Not long after we passed the Steamer <name type="boat" ref="#Shellal">Shellal</name>, a complete wreck, and partly submerged. She was deserted and in the hands of the wreckers - having stove a hole in her bottom on some unsuspected stones in the river. Half an hour after sitting at luncheon, our boat gave a sudden lurch, and there was a grinding of stones under her bow. We all rushed on forward deck, fearing some real calamity; but examination showed no leak, and we came on our way rejoicing; but it was rather nervous work for awhile. Next we saw one of the large Gage steamers, empty, and abandoned, and left tied to the bank, to wait for higher water, so that she could get down the river. Then we came up the <name type="boat" ref="#Ammartis">Ammartis,</name> who had got off the sand, and passed us a short time before, transferring her passengers to the <persName>Tewfik</persName>, who was sending her to the <placeName>Ammartis</placeName> - the latter drawing less water. So when we found ourselves tonight 6 miles below <placeName ref="#Al_Wasta">Wasta</placeName> and having made 37 miles, and only touched sand once for a moment, we congratulated ourselves. A beautiful day and evening.</p>

Reached <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> and landed by 8 o'clock - had breakfast at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Hotel">Grand</name> - and then a charming drive up the hill and over to <placeName>Posillippo</placeName>, and then back in time for early lunch, and off for <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> by one o'clock - which we reached for dinner in our pleasant sitting room at 7:30.
