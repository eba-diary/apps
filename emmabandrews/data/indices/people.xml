Burton was then employed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as a photographer for the museum's "Egyptian Expedition." Burton worked for the Met until his death in 1940. Harry Burton captured more than 7,500 excavation photographs in and around the Valley of the Kings throughout his career working in Egypt during the early 20th century. His photographs of sites such as Thebes, Deir el-Bahri, and Wadi Natrun brought him great regard as one of the foremost archaeological photographers of his time. He is most famous for his documentation of Howard Carter’s discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, 1922-1933. Most of his work was done between 1911-1936.
