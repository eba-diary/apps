                    of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden Age' of Egyptian
                    archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A

We have <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary Newberry</persName> and her daughter, <persName ref="#Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName>, with us, making their first acquaintance with these southern waters.

It has been a busy week in <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> - <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName> have been sightseeing and motoring about.

We spoke of the magnificent cover to the so-called Tyii' coffin which has never been shown to the public and is kept entirely apart in a private room. A man capable of repairing it has been found, and has agreed to do the whole thing and to finish it within 5 months. The gold work, as well as the exquisite inlay - it will be a grand addition to <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>'s exhibit at the <placeName ref="#Boulaq_Museum">Museum</placeName>.
