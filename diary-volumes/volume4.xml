          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <name ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</name> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the <orgName ref="#'Golden_Age'">'Golden Age'</orgName> of <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <name ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</name> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <name ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</name> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the University of Washington. <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis.</persName> Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile,</placeName> including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings. <persName ref="#Emma">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering <orgName ref="#Egyptologists">Egyptologists</orgName> of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

        <p><pb n="73"/>We sailed at 10 o'clock on Saturday the 14th - <persName ref="#Convers_Mr">Mr. Convers</persName>, <persName ref="#Luling_Mr">Mr. Luling</persName> and <persName ref="#Jevons_Mr">Mr. Jevons</persName> were down to see us off. A cold bright morning - and the cold lasted until yesterday - everyone congealed - but we are now in warmer waters - and constant sunshine - I have a large bright room - at a table in which I am writing. The sun looks into my port by day, and the moon by night -for we have fortunately fallen upon the second quarter of the moon. The last thing I do, after having turned out the light at night, is to climb up on the sofa, and take a look at the night, and the wide waste: of blue black water, in which our ship makes its great furrow of dashing white foam - what a beautiful immensity it is, and a grand picture to carry into the oblivion of the night.</p>
        <p>There are comparatively few passangers - and I have never known such pleasant ones. The <persName ref="#Hamilton_Fisks_Group">Hamilton Fisks</persName> of <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> - <persName ref="#Doty_Dr">Dr. Doty</persName>, the Health Officer of the <placeName ref="#New_York_Port">N.

We all have tea together in the afternoon, and make very merry - and we have <persName ref="#Bend_Beatrice">Mrs. Bend</persName> of <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> and her two daughters at our table. I asked <persName ref="#Pratt_Edward">Mr. Pratt</persName> how long <persName ref="#Benjamin_Samuel">Benjamin,</persName> former Minister to <placeName ref="#Persia">Persia,</placeName> had lived in that country, and he said 3 years. I said that was rather a short time acquaintance with a country about which to write an exhaustive work. He tole me <persName ref="#Benjamin_Samuel">Benjamin</persName> had given great offence to the Shela, and others in his book - and that he had seen absolutely nothing of parts of <placeName ref="#Persia">Persia</placeName> about which he writes.</p>

        <p><pb n="74"/> We will reach <placeName ref="#Genoa">Genoa</placeName> in a few hours, and I will gladly say au revoir to the sea for 3 or 4 days. It is very cold this morning, but clear. Until we reached <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> our beautiful balmy weather lasted. We passed the <placeName ref="#Azores">Azoros</placeName> on the 20th - running very close to the large island of <placeName ref="#Sao_Miguel">San Miguel</placeName> - very picturesque with its background of mountains, and the steep slopes, some of them quite cultivated to the top - its pleasant looking houses and villages - and the miles of low grass houses, where immense quantities of pineapples are cultivated. On Monday morning the 23d we reached <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar,</placeName> and went ashore, despite of some threatening clouds. We took <persName ref="#Bend_Beatrice">Beatrice Bend</persName> in our carriage and went as far as <placeName ref="#Europa_Point">Europa Point,</placeName> but before we again reached the town, rain began to fall, and there was nothing to do but stop at the wretched <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Royal">Hotel Royal,</name> and wait until it was time to go back to the steamer - and there we waited staring out on the same little square where I spent so many hours doing the same thing two years ago. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went out and bought 3 umbrellas - a pair of overshoes for me, and 3 yards of macintosh cloth for us to sit upon on the wet, unprotected decks of the little tender. From that time until last night the gale has raged - and 3 miserable nights have I spent and 2 days in my forward cabin, tossed up and down. Yesterday morning early the 26, we dropped our anchor in the bay of <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> - and in spite of some rain and a high wind, I went ashore with the rest, and spent a pleasant day. The two Bend girls we took immediately to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Hotel">Grand Hotel,</name> and found pleasant rooms for them, and by the time <persName ref="#Bend_Beatrice">Mrs. Bend</persName> arrived from the <pb n="75"/> <name type="historical" ref="#Custom_House">Custom House,</name> we had ordered luncheon, and made a short visit to the Aquarium. How good that lunch was, and how good the stable land was! Then we said goodbye to our friends, and started back to the steamer - stopping a few moments at <name type="historical" ref="#Squadriblis">Squadriblis</name> to buy some shell things. We have had a quiet night, and are running smoothly this morning.</p>

        <p>I am so thankful that this long voyage has almost come to an end - and that we will arrive at <placeName ref="#Port_Said">Port Said</placeName> early tomorrow morning - we reached <placeName ref="#Genoa">Genoa</placeName> on the 27 Nov. just too late to catch the only train to <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> at noon - and after a slight delay at the <name type="historical" ref="#Custom_House">Custom House</name>, made a long journey through the streets of the town to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_du_Pare">"Hotel du Pare"</name> a rather attractive looking ancient Villa standing in large grounds with trees, which might be cheerful on a summers day, but on that chill afternoon, dripping with rain, was truly disconsolate. The palatial rooms and halls, with their tiny fires and enormous windows shaking and rattling in the gale, made us thankful we were only going to stop for the night. The next day we were off for <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> at 12 o'clock - which we reached at 7 P.M. - a weary ride - slow and rough, through never ending tunnels. The girls and <persName ref="#Hassan">Hassan</persName> were waiting for us, and went with us to the <name type="#hotel" ref="#Hotel_Royal_Grande_Bretagne">Grande Bretagne,</name> where we were installed in our old appartment. <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> the next day was cold, but bright. I spent the Sunday morning with <persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName> shopping - I found her chattering Italian like a native. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> went to the <name type="historical" ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Uffizzi</name> - <pb n="76"/> <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> to do as much of the town as they could. <persName ref="#Buttles_Lizzie">Lizzie</persName> and both girls came to breakfast, and the girls stopped to lunch - after which a drive to <placeName ref="#Fiesole">Fiesole,</placeName> and the rest of the time with <persName ref="#Buttles_Lizzie">Lizzie</persName> in their pretty little appartment, 2 Via Venezia, and then all came home with us to dinner. <persName ref="#Berenson_Bernard">Berenson</persName> also came to dinner, looking very well. The next day we were off to <placeName ref="#Genoa">Genoa</placeName> again, with <persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName> along and went for the night to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Isotta">"Hotel Isotta",</name> much more comfortable than the other. At 2 o'clock the next day we went out to the Frederick the Great - and after enormous trouble and anxiety, through the insufficiency and want of order of the North German Lloyd Co. we succeeded at last in getting all our 30 pieces of luggage out of the <name type="historical" ref="#Custom_House">Custom House</name> and aboard the steamer - and sailed about 5 o'clock the next morning for <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples.</placeName> We found the steamer very pleasant, but rather durious in her arrangement. Large as she is she only carries 120 first class passengers - but she carries enormous freight to <placeName ref="#Australia">Australia</placeName> - her decks are charming - the service and the food very poor. Reached <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> the next morning - rain pouring - everyone else went ashore - I stayed at home - <persName ref="#Peabody_Dr">Dr. Peabody</persName> and family, <persName ref="#Pratt_Edward">Mr. Pratt</persName> and <persName ref="#Doty_Dr">Dr. Doty</persName> arrived in the afternoon. So did the <name type="boat" ref="#Kaiser_Wilhelm_II">Kaiser Wilhelm,</name> just from <placeName ref="#New_York">New York,</placeName> a week later than ourselves. We were at last off on the home stretch for <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at 6 P.M. Since then the weather has been bad, and heavy seas until today - which is lovely.

        <p><pb n="77"/> We arrived day before yesterday the 7th at 6 P.M. and took possession of our pleasant old appartment facing the street no. 120 et suite. On the evening of the 6th we passed the <name type="historical" ref="#Damietta_Lighthouse">Damietta</name> light, and the ship steamed slowly and almost imperceptibly along until she dropped anchor at <placeName ref="#Port_Said">Port Said</placeName> about 2 o'clock A.M. There was but little sleep to be had - what with the coaling, the babbling and shrieking outside, and the stir inside - and as the night was warm, and all the doors and ports closed because of the coaling, sleep was far from every one. At 6 o'clock <persName ref="#Burgnoyne_Amelie">Amilie</persName> came to call me, and I was glad to give up the struggle and get up. We had little trouble at the <name type="historical" ref="#Custom_House">Custom House,</name> and were soon in a clean and very comfortable railway carriage for <placeName ref="#Ismailia">Ismailia,</placeName> where we got an excellent lunch at the new hotel established lately by <persName ref="#Shepheards_Group">Shepheards,</persName> and waited for the <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> train. We find <name type="hotel" ref="#Shepheards_Hotel">Shepheards</name> practically empty - and this season is to be a bad one for <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> I fear. The next morning we had a grand disappointment in finding that our boat was a month behind time - painters and carpenters still at work - the boom not raised, and general helplessness. The English foreman of <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron</persName> is quite ineffectual - and <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron</persName> has shown gross negligence and carelessness. Instead of the boat ready, and in sailing order for the 1st of Dec. as the contract calls for - <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron</persName> has evidently given his whole attention to building gunboats up the river. He has been at <placeName ref="#Dongola">Dongola</placeName> for 3 months - and has allowed the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> to care for herself. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> with admirable patience made <pb n="78"/> himself master of facts through the dire confusion of falsehoods and incompetency, and then he went for <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron</persName> and his foreman, with such well directed effort and so much energetic talking, that the foreman is scared out of his life, and the workmen are jumping about like monkeys. I am busy all the time now with an hundred practical details.</p>

The great trouble now is that the furniture was not shipped from <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName> until the 6th of Dec.! We have engaged our old cook <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Hanna</persName> - poor <persName ref="#Selim">Selim</persName> having died here not more than a month ago - <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Hanna</persName> speaks no French or English, but as we have engaged a very promising young Nubian as waiter whom <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Salah</persName> knows very well, and who has lived for years in <placeName ref="#England">England,</placeName> we can get on very well. <persName ref="#Ibrahim_Hanna">Ibrahim</persName> too is engaged as 2d man and laundress - and my <!--Is this the same person as Ibrahim Hanna?--><persName ref="#Ibrahim_Mohammed">Mohammed Ibrahim</persName> is going in no capacity that I can think of, except to learn more English, and if he can, to wait and do domestic work.

          Second Sunday after Christmas. <date when="1897-01-03">Jan. 3</date>.
        </dateline>
        <p>Still waiting impatiently to get off - some progress has been made during the past week to be sure. The obscure and troublesome - <pb n="80"/> Jan. 9th - what I intended saying when I began that last sentence, quite a week ago, I have now not the faintest idea. Each day since has been so busy, with tiresome occupations, driving down to the dahabeah through that squalid <placeName ref="#Boulak_Ramleh">Boulak-Ramleh</placeName> quarter - until I am fairly sick with the sight of so much misery that no one can relieve. The long delayed furniture came yesterday - and with much trepidation I saw it unpacked, and if my worst fears were not realized, there were enough disappointments to make it almost unbearable. Chairs too large for the rooms - everything a little too big, or a little too small - the side board entirely forgotten - and I had to get into the carriage with <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron,</persName> and drive to 3 different furniture places before I found a little second hand buffet that freshened and polished, will answer for this winter - then I bought finger bowls, caraffes - liqeur glasses - candlesticks - match boxes - soap dishes etc. etc. etc. Still with all these drawbacks the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> is so comfortable and so convenient and pretty, that we are thoroughly happy that on Monday morning we will take possession of her, and at last start up the river. We have had real <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> winter weather for 10 days - high winds, clouds, occasional sharp rains. These things would not be unbearable - were it not for the discomfort of indoors in such weather. We would never think it possible at home to sit in a room where the thermometer stood at 62&#176; only. But my thermometer has been just there for several days. There is in each of our big rooms, a tiny, ornamented accidental fireplace, between two of the big windows - these are strictly ornamental, and are almost hidden by the magnificent satin draperies of the windows. But two or <pb n="81"/> three days ago when the wind was high and cold, I asked the waiter if we could have a fire, and it was made, much to the cost of our comfort, for the only draught was out into the room - and if the fuel had been anything but charcoal, the consequences might have been disastrous - as it was, all the wooden mantle was scorched, and the windows had to be opened to clear the room. We learned afterwards that there were no openings at the top to these chimneys - so that the fireplaces were purely pieces of ornamental furniture.</p>

        <p>We are actually in possession - have started - and made 15 miles to <placeName ref="#Al_Badrashayn">Bedrasheen,</placeName> where we are now lying. <!--Double check Mary name tag for all others--><persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName> and I flew about this morning doing last things - we lunched at the <name type="historical" ref="#Ghezireh Palace">Gesireh</name>, but went down before lunch on the terrace, to see the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin,</name> under convoy of the tug, go by, on her way to above the bridge, which opens at one o'clock. Just as we reached the terrace, I saw away down the river, the tug pulling out, and our "<name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name>" stately, tall, and shapely in her tow. Several people gathered on the terrace to see her go by - and I heard her pronounced the "handsomest craft on the river". Immediately after lunch, when poor <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> had finished all his backsheeshs, we drove above the bridge, and went aboard. There was hurry and scrambling for 15 minutes, as our trunks were literally turned upside down, and sent back empty to the hotel to be kept for us, until we came down. In the midst of it, <!--Proper convention?--><persName ref="#Taylor_Mrs">Mrs.</persName> and <persName ref="#Taylor_Miss">Miss Taylor</persName> arrived for a parting visit. Then there was the "debbil to pay" as dear old <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Salah</persName> would say, as <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> <pb n="82"/> discovered that the men on the tug did not know that they were to go further than above the bridge, and were aghast at the idea of taking us as far as <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiut;</placeName> they had no food - no blankets - no preparations, but go they had to, and with many a heartfelt blessing from us all to the impossible <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubron,</persName> we started at 3:40 this P.M. I have been working like a slave all the afternoon, and am too tired to see or think, but we are happy, if not yet in order.</p>

        <p>We have made about 18 miles - and are somewhere between <placeName ref="#Badrashin">Bedreschein</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Al_Wasta">Wasta.</placeName> The tug proves a worthless thing. She can make about 2 miles with us, an hour, without any assistance from us - but if we have a wind that at all fills our sails, we sail right on to her and she has to cast off. Various "d&#233;sagr&#233;mens" have developed themselves, the most important of which is old <persName ref="#Henna">Henna,</persName> our cook, who was with us for 2 winters on the <name type="boat" ref="#Herodotus_Boat">Herodotus</name> has taken fright at the range in his kitchen, and thinks he can do nothing with it, although he makes much better bread with it, than I have ever known him do before. And, we greatly need the forgotten sideboard - and many rather necessary things have been overlooked. However, we are so pretty and convenient, that we are quite ashamed of ourselves in complaining of anything. My room is entirely charming - and so are all the bedrooms in their pretty chintzs and simple fittings - and the saloon would be a charming interior anywhere - with its Morris green brocades and art fabrics. Then the big upper deck is entirely perfection, with its pretty rugs, its big brown <pb n="83"/> wicker hooded chairs and easy chairs, with their bright yellow and black cushions and pillows in bandana stuffs. But best of all, the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> has proved a rattling good sailor, and there can be no happier man on earth than our <persName ref="#Fuli_Rais">Rais Fuli,</persName> who for the first time in his life is 1st Captain. He has been twice with us as 2d Captain and we have always said he should be captain of our dahabeah when it was built. He is such a fine specimen of a calm, serene <orgName ref="#Mohammedan">Mohammedan,</orgName> and has a gentle personal dignity I have never seen equalled. He is a <orgName ref="#Nubian">Nubian</orgName>, knows the river thoroughly, and we could trust him with everything we have. The boat will now be his house summer as well as winter - and he will get &#65505;3. a month and during the summer feed himself - I think I am as pleased as he is. He has chosen an admirable crew - I never saw so good a one on the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> - and in their brown cardigans with "<name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name>" in blue letters across the breast, they look very well.</p>

        <p>I wakened before it was light this morning and heard the rippling of the water that showed how fast we were slipping along - but, a little after 7 o'clock we ran into a dense fog - I never saw such a sight before on the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> - and we pulled up awhile until the hot sun had dissipated it.

        <p>A very disappointing day. <persName ref="#Thubron_Ernest">Thubrons</persName> wretched little tug has given out entirely, and been abandoned by us. The Engineer reported early this morning a leak in the boiler - but as that has been the case for several days, it seemed to be no reason that we should not go on in the same slow way. So <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went aboard the tug - found that the engineer in order to "see in the boiler" as he said, had taken off the cylinder head, and then found a loose nut kicking about somewhere, and said if he moved their lives would be in danger.

        <p>A trying day as far as getting on - warm, still and a haze that about noon assumed a rather threatening look. Our fellows have tracked and pulled to the anchor - and in this fashion we have been creeping past the <placeName ref="#Gebel_Abu_Foda">Abu Fedah</placeName> cliffs this afternoon. A strong north wind sprang up and helped us along, though the weather was so threatening we did not dare hoist a sail. About 6 o'clock the gale broke upon us - but no rain, and we are safely tied up for the night under the lee of a high bank. The air has cleared and the moon shows faintly from a veil of light clouds.</p>

        <p>We began sailing at 8 o'clock this morning with a strong north wind - and the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> had her first good opportunity to test her true sailing qualities. She behaved splendidly to the great delight of her Captain and her crew, to say nothing of her owner. She sailed on the wind in so fine a fashion, that the crew were enthusiastic. I found the wind too strong on deck, and went below to the entrance deck, where I stood sometime watching the sailors, who were laughing and cheering apostrophising the wind - then the boat - then shaking hands in congratulation. We careered and made more motion than I have ever felt on the <pb n="87"/> <placeName ref="Nile">Nile</placeName>.- but then we had never sailed like that in such a wind before. In the midst of our triumphal progress in making a difficult bend of the river we came in collision with a working or ferry boat, anchored just at the point. Her boom scraped our sides a little to the great distress of <persName ref="#Fuli_Rais">Rais Fuli</persName> - but no real harm done. In swinging round to avoid as much as possible the shock of the contact, we went aground on the sand - and it was 3 hours before we got off, so that we did not reach <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiut</placeName> until after 5 P.M. - too late to go into the town - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore,</persName> <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> set off for the P.O.

        <p><persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName> and I took <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName> this morning, and rowed down to the town, and took a carriage there. We made a few little purchases - drove through the bazaars, to the imminent risk it seemed to me of the lives of everybody there - certainly to their great discomfort. These carriages are an innovation. I have never seen them before. In trying to find some flower pots, I came across a young Egyptian in European dress, who got into the carriage with us, and took us to his garden, where he gave us everything that was in bloom, which was not much, as the gardens are at this season practically dead as to flowers. Among other things he gave us 2 remarkable fruits I had never seen before, which he called "Kishta" or cream. It seems it is an imported delicacy <pb n="88"/> from the <placeName ref="#West_Indies">West Indies</placeName> - the Anona squamosa. I got my pots - but we were not allowed to pay for anything - our young host being an amateur gardiner, and as polite and kind as he could be. After many thanks, we left him and came home, it being too late to go to the <!--Unsure what college this is built so early--><name>American College</name> as I had intended, to inquire about the 2 American women doctors who have lately arrived and about whom I wish to know something.

The great cliffs of <placeName ref="#Gebel_Harêdi">El Haradeh</placeName> have been near us all day - their soft yellow, with heliotrope, and ashes of roses shadows. It seems a bad employment of time to read, or work, or look at anything but this strange country - with its simplicity of feature, the changing life of the banks of the river, - one of the most interesting things is the ferry boats - with their loads of men, women, children, and every description of animal. They are common working sail boats - their sails sometimes so tattered and chiffonn&#233;e that one wonders there can be any propelling power about them. Then they cannot often approach the low shores, and men and women unceremoniously kilt up their clothes and wade to shore, driving their animals before them, or dragging them <pb n="90"/> after. It is no unusual thing to see donkeys lifted bodily into these boats and the other day we were much diverted by seeing 3 camels, scolding their protests, lifted in as it were in sections, - one leg at a time.

The sister well clothed, in the usual Arab fashion - veiled as becomes a married woman - and <persName ref="#Zenobia">Zenobia</persName> as pretty and taking, and round and brown, as she used to be. I fear it will be impossible to get her into the Italian school - but I may succeed with the American Mission school when I go down. I would like to lift the child somewhat out of her dirt and poverty. For the first time at <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor,</placeName> I rode in one of the carriages, <pb n="95"/> 2 or 3 of which are supplied by the Hotel - and I felt almost ashamed of myself - one doesn't like to see such unnecessary innovations.</p>

I thought it very pretty, but I believe one song is used for various words.

        <p>Before 5 o'clock this morning, I heard the preparations for departure. Our splendid big boom was taken down the day we spent at <placeName ref="#Philae">Philae</placeName> - and for 2 or 3 days the boat has been getting ready for her downward journey. We have had a lovely week at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> - the pleasantest I have ever known - at our same old landing, with the same views before us, we felt quite at home. <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName> has greatly improved since we were here, the river front has been faced with stone, and steps made here and there to the water. The main street following the river bank is now clean, and quite well built, with some good government houses, <pb n="99"/> which with the hotel, give a very bright, clean look. It is very quiet almost no soldiers at the garrison - all having gone to the front. I like the air here better than any place along the river - it is so pure and so entirely from the desert, there being so little vegetation here. A day or two after we arrived, <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce</persName> and <persName ref="#Fitz_Hardinge_Lord">Lord Fitz-Hardinge</persName> came to call. The <persName ref="#Fitz_Hardinge_Group">Fitz-Hardinges</persName> have the little <name type="boat" ref="#Thames">Thames</name> which they built years ago - and <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce</persName> on his <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar,</name> was just behind us. A nice, entertaining young fellow with the <persName ref="#Fitz_Hardinge_Group">Fitz-Hardinges,</persName> <persName ref="#Bridgman_Dr">Dr. Bridgman,</persName> who found him an enthusiastic gardener, and the only person I ever met who could tell me anything about horticulture in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt.</placeName> We had <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce</persName> one evening to dinner - and found him very interesting - telling us a great many things we wanted to know. We left <persName ref="#Fitz_Hardinge_Lord">Lord Fitz-Hardinge</persName> very ill - with threatened pneumonia. He has during the past year succeeded to the title, we having formerly known of him as <persName ref="#Fitz_Hardinge_Lord">Hon. Mr. Berkeley.</persName> With this title which is one of the oldest in <placeName ref="#England">England,</placeName> dating from the time of <persName ref="#Stephen_King">King Stephen,</persName> he has become owner of <name type="historical" ref="#Berkeley_Castle">Berkeley Castle</name> one of the most interesting historical Castles of England, and also to an income of &#65505;70,000 a year. He has no children, he and his wife are past 60 - have very quiet tastes - devoted to church work - schools and charities, and terribly depressed by this change of fortune, which breaks up old habits, and entails so much state and responsibility for which they have no liking. The next heir, is <persName ref="#Berkeley_Lord">Lord Berkeley</persName> of <placeName ref="#Oxford">Oxford</placeName> - a man no longer young - no children, and who cares only for chemistry and geology - and devoutly dreads the day when he shall succeed. - Next to him is an unmarried woman not young, the oldest of 9 children of a clergyman, who has just 600 &#65505;s <pb n="100"/> to spend a year! <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce</persName> on the <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar,</name> started down at the same time we did this morning - but he told us yesterday, that he would float faster than we could, as his boat is heavy, with a keel - one of the heavy, old fashioned wooden boats, which would not have the ghost of a chance with us in sailing. We have floated against the wind, but with so little progress that at 7 this morning we stopped judging we have made about 15 miles. We are lying in the cove of the bend of the river, at anchor, some distance from shore, with the "<name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name>" near below, her lights showing hospitably against this desert shore. The night most resplendent, the moon full and the great yellow sand drifts over the mountain sides, glowing with almost as much color as they do by day. I would not have my blinds closed, and slept with all the curtains back from the windows that I might get all the outside beauty possible - and waking several times during the night, I sat up in my bed and looked out at it all. What beautiful, resplendent loneliness!</p>

        <p>We made about 3 miles, starting at half past 6 this morning, but this wretched north wind increasing we gave it up, and lay again in the stream as the shore was so sandy - the <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name> almost a mile below us. <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce</persName> sent over a note, asking us to come to tea - which we did going down in the felucca - very hard rowing against the wind, even with the current, and there really were waves. We had a charming visit <persName ref="#S_Showing_Prof">Prof. S. Showing</persName> us some of his interesting works on <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - <persName ref="#Belzoni_Giovanni">Belzoni's</persName> splendid great volume, with hand painted pictures of the temples and <pb n="101"/> tombs - his rendering of the hieroglyphs, being remarkably accurate, though at that time there was no key to them - and of course he was ignorant of their meaning - and it was like copying any other detail of decoration. The great Napeonic work, of the French Scientific Expedition which I had never seen before - the travels of <!--Unsure who this is--><persName>Ligh,</persName> the Englishman a copy of which <persName ref="#Amory_Howard">Howard Amory</persName> gave me from his grandfather's library, and others - one an account of travel written by an Italian <persName ref="#Valle_Della_Pietro">"del Valle"</persName> in 16     . The <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name> is a big, old fashioned boat, and looked most comfortable - 20 ft. wide. We and <persName>Cooks</persName> new boats are 17 ft. This width gives her a beautiful saloon, and a wide corridor to the stern cabin, which is also very large, and fitted as a library - with bookcases to the ceiling - a charming, scholarly room - and here <persName ref="#S_Showing_Prof">Prof. S.</persName> says he really does his work for the whole year. Another wonderful night but the wind as strong as ever - and we are rocking uncomfortably - indeed I never rocked so much on the river as we have been doing all day.</p>

Wind continued all day, and weather hopeless. I began reading <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Prof. Sayce's</persName> <!--Tag later book-->"Egypt of the Hebrews".

        <p>We did not get away until 7 o'clock this morning - and had not lost sight of the town when a very hard north wind sprang up, and after trying to float, gave it up and anchored, until about 4 o'clock, when it came out a little to the south, and we gladly spread our sails, and had soon come to a big turn in the river which brought the wind on our side, so that we could not keep off the bank. Found here tied up, under the same circumstances, the <name type="boat" ref="#Osiris">Osiris</name> which left <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> the day before us, and the <name type="boat" ref="#Ammon_Ra">Ammon-Ra</name> who got away an hour before us this morning - and here we all are for the night. Two Mecca pilgrims going to <placeName ref="#Mecca">Mecca</placeName> stopped on the bank above us after the sun had gone down, to break the long fast of the day and eat their evening meal.

        <p>A very early start this morning and rowing and floating in company with the <name type="boat" ref="#Ammon_Ra">Ammon-Ra</name> and the <name type="boat" ref="#Osiris">Osiris,</name> we reached <placeName ref="#Keneh">Keneh</placeName> about 3 o'clock, and the rest started in the felucca, before we reached the opposite landing for <placeName ref="#Temple_of_Dendera">Denderah</placeName>, and we floated down below and waited for them. Very hot for 2 hours - found the <name type="boat" ref="#Columbia">Columbia</name> at <placeName ref="#Temple_of_Dendera">Denderah</placeName>. They reported on coming home, very unruly donkey boys, and very exciting rows with them. All the morning we were just in advance of the <name type="boat" ref="#Osiris">Osiris</name>, <pb n="107"/>and she floated most unpleasantly near us - two or three times we were actually in collision side by side, and great commotion among the crews. <persName ref="#Oswald_St_Lord">Lord St. Oswald</persName> is on her. They all came back in an hour and a half, and we floated and rowed 3 or 4 miles farther down - and tied up with strong wind blowing from the north, at 6:30. I enjoyed a walk on deck while they were away - looking at the splendid desert mountains across the river beyond <placeName ref="#Keneh">Keneh</placeName>. What a hot, desolate spot <placeName ref="#Keneh">Keneh</placeName> must have been last summer, when the cholera raged so violently! I have never been in the town but once - and it lies so back from the river that it cannot be well seen. I suppose just now the Mecca pilgrims are crowding them on their way to <placeName ref="#Mecca">Mecca</placeName> - I should like to have ridden into the town today, and out a way upon the <placeName ref="#Koser">Koser</placeName> road.

        <p>Early this morning, we managed to make about 10 yards - but the wind increasing we tied up again - and now lying just as we did all day yesterday at the mercy of the wind, blowing across miles of sand. For days the sky has been full of clouds and last evening they were so ominous, that I hoped the night would bring rain, and perhaps break this deadly magic spell of north wind - but it has been even worse today. We have had the boat as tightly closed as possible, but the air everywhere has been thick with this fine, impalpable sand.</p>

Just where there is a group of palms - and the white little mosque against the yellow cliffs. Luckily it was not a hot day, or the reflection from those towering limestone cliffs would have been insufferable. But how the wind has blown - in our sheltered position however we got no sand. The canvass on the river side, and over the deck, and at the back were put up - leaving the land side with its pretty sights open - and under the hooded seats, the deck was charming for sitting. All the others went to walk, but I took mine on the clean deck. The <name type="boat" ref="#Columbia">Columbia</name> came in sight this morning, and drew up just above us. At 6:30 we both went off, in the bright moonlight, the wind having fallen very much - and the men are still rowing. (They rowed until 12:30, thus making <measure type="distance">27 miles</measure>).

        <p>An early start in a good wind brought us along so surprisingly that we were near <placeName ref="#Al_Badrashayn">Bedrascheen</placeName> at 10:30, having discovered some minutes before that beautiful view of the dome and slender minarets of <persName ref="#Ali_Mohammed">Mohammed Ali</persName> - shining in the sun above the thick haze, looking like some enchanted palace. The sailing was so fine, and the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name> showing her paces so splendidly, that we suddenly decided we would not stop for the visit to <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName>, and kept on for the <placeName>Museum</placeName> landing at <placeName ref="#Giza">Ghizeh</placeName>. The sky being full of great clouds, very unlike <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - all the morning the blue sky making such delightful contrasts with their great swelling white domes, and the pyramids of <placeName ref="#Al_Lisht">Lisht</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Dahshūr">Dashur</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#Ṣaqqâra">Sakkarah</placeName> showing splendidly - until quite in a moment the clouds grew dirty and the atmosphere thick, the wind increased, and we were blown to the bank, with <pb n="114"/> great effort escaping collision with the rocky foundation of a big sakiyeh on the top of which as usual a blindfolded bullock was walking round and round his wheel. Here we have been ever since, the wind growing into a gale, and the opposite shore almost hidden by the clouds of sand blowing across its sandy waste. We are quite sheltered here from it, though we get enough of it as the atmosphere is so charged with it and when in the afternoon it began softly to rain, the drops seemed like mud, and made a fine mess of our clean windows. The waves beat so high and roughly on the lee shore against which we lay, that the two feluccas, were in danger, and our men worked almost stripped, for 2 hours before they were bailed and lifted to a place of safety. In my stern room the uproar was tremendous - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName> went for a walk, but were driven home by the wind and rain, and there was a great fracas on deck, getting everything under canvass, safe from the wet.

        <p>A long interval in this journal. We left <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> the afternoon of the 3d in the fine new <name type="boat" ref="#SS_Bohemia">S.S. Bohemia</name> for <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName>. Weather very warm - and we were glad of the welcome change which two or three hours at sea brought. Boat very comfortable - but passage rough - almost every one in his bed - I stayed in mine Sunday and Monday - and we landed at <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName> at 5 o'clock and made our train, because they were complaisant enough to hold our train 40 minutes for us. The long ride to <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> was not so tiring, and seemed more pleasant than usual. So delightful the country seemed in its fresh spring greenness - and the huge vegetable garden which stretches as far as the eye can see, without boundaries, for miles before reaching <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName>, is something quite wonderful. Everything planted under the thin foliaged trees, with their garlands <pb n="119"/> of vines stretching from tree to tree. We found pleasant rooms at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Hotel">Grand Hotel</name>, but <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> had taken a cold in crossing, which developed into a light form of grippe, which gave him much suffering and restlessness - and he had the <persName ref="#Malbranc_Dr">Doctor (Malbrane)</persName> who is always so simple and helpful, and stayed in the room all the time, and one day in bed. As the weather was not good, clouds everywhere, <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> and the islands hidden from view most of the time, I stayed at home with <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> - and on Saturday the 10th he was well enough to come on here - <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName>, <persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName>, <persName ref="#Burgnoyne_Amelie">Amilie</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> spent one day at <placeName ref="#Pompeii">Pompeii</placeName>, and <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName> the next day at <placename ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placename>. We had rooms engaged at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Quirinale">Quirinal</name>, but found them much too small and fortunately having had an offer from the <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Bernini_Bristol">Bristol</name> we came here, which is always my favorite hotel in <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName>. But alas, I have since coming here developed the grippe also - and have been in bed and in the house all the time until yesterday, as uncomfortable as I ever remember of being - with <persName ref="#Bull_Dr">Dr. Bull</persName> in daily attendance. All the world more or less is in <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> - and to my thinking <name type="event" ref="#Holy_Week">Holy Week</name> is not the time to visit <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName>, unless one is interested in church ceremonies.

It was not quite my idea of enjoyment - sitting at 5 o'clock P.M. on rugs on the ground at the top of a windy hill - but <persName ref="#Elliot_Mrs">Mrs. Elliott's</persName> intention was good and kind. The next morning, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#Parsons_Mary">Mary</persName> and I went to <name type="historical" ref="#St_Peters_Basilica">St. Peters</name> and saw the lovely <persName ref="#da_Forli_Melozzo">Melozzo</persName> angels and frescoes in the inner sacristy - then drove to the <name type="historical" ref="#Colosseum">Colosseum</name> and along the <placeName ref="#Via_San_Gregorio">Via S.

But the weather had changed and the wind was cold - so we drove to the <name type="historical" ref="#Piazza_Rusticucci">Piazzo Rusticucci</name> to say goodbye to <persName ref="#Elliot_Mrs">Mrs. Elliott</persName> and had a pleasant visit - meeting for the first time <persName ref="#Elliot_John">Mr. Elliott</persName> - a handsome, rather invalid looking man, whom I liked - especially when he took me on to his roof garden which he cultivates entirely himself, and which has charming views of <placeName ref="#San_Pietro">S.

The 3 different entrances to the church were lined with collections of blind, lame and halt, and the poor things all begging.

Then we drove about the town, with its handsome well shaded streets and modern houses, and picturesque river bank, and were quite delighted with it - but long before we had finished our drive, one of the horses being rather restive broke his traces, and we were forced to leave the carriage - <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I taking a cab to the hotel, and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Clarence">Clarence</persName> walking. We are having a dull evening - in our big gloomy rooms - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> is not well - seems to have taken cold, and has been sleeping ever since dinner.</p>

        <p>Yesterday morning <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> seemed much better, but not well enough to venture upon a visit to stony, cold galleries. So <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I went off at 10 o'clock for a morning in the Egyptian department. What was our dismay and disgust at finding the <name type="historical" ref="#Palazzo_dell_Accademia_delle_Scienze">Museum</name> did not open until 1 o'clock - <pb n="126"/> and we starting for <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> at 2:10! So we ordered lunch at 12:30 and immediately afterwards started again for the <name type="historical" ref="#Palazzo_dell_Accademia_delle_Scienze">Mus&#233;e</name>, intending to drive from there in half an hour to the station, meeting the rest there. On reaching the gallery we deposited our parasols with the custodian and quickly toiled up those great staircases, only to find the doors of the Egyptian department closed! No words could describe our indignation and dismay - we tried bribery - demanded the director, who was not there of course, and baffled and angry we had to return to our hotel - wishing we had gone as usual to <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> by the <placeName ref="#Basel">Basle</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Luzern">Lucerne</placeName> route. We got away from <placeName ref="#Turin">Turin</placeName> at 2:30 and found 2 very comfortable compartments reserved for us in the sleeping car - and the afternoon proved delightful. The Scenery was beautiful - grand with splendid effects - I think I never enjoyed a railway ride so much. As with the help of 2 powerful engines we climbed the <placeName ref="#Cenis_Mount">Mt. Cenis</placeName> mountain route, it was charming - green smiling plains - snow tipped mountains - streams of rushing, tumbling water pouring down the mountains sides - and every where fascinating Alpine plants growing - such as we try to cultivate in our rock gardens at home, and generally fail in doing. The night was very comfortable - our beds clean - and by 9 o'clock we were established in our familiar apartments here, which we have already occupied twice before. <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> looks quiet. Few Americans here, it is said.</p>

        <p>A very dreadful thing happened here yesterday - about 4 o'clock in the afternoon: a charity Bazaar was being held in a large building built and often used for such purposes in the <placeName ref="#Rue_Jean_Goujon">Rue Jean Gonjou</placeName> near the <placeName ref="#Palaiz_de_l_Industrie">Palais de l'Industrie</placeName>. At the time it was crowded with people representing the very best element in French society. The <persName ref="#Charlotte_Sophie_Duchess">Duchesse d'Alen&#231;on</persName> sister of the <persName ref="#Eugenie_Elisabeth_Amalie">Queen of Austria</persName> being at the head of it. Suddenly flames broke out, in an instant the light painted wooden roof was in flames, and within 20 minutes the whole thing with nearly 200 of the audience, who did not succeed in escaping, were all a charred and smoking mass. People escaped without clothing, and shoes. The crowd of waiting carriages did not receive half of their occupants - almost before help could be rendered the thing was over - the <persName ref="#Charlotte_Sophie_Duchess">Duchesse d'Alen&#231;on</persName> was burned at her stall, and no remnant of her has been discovered. The streets are almost silent - a pall over the whole city - one thinks, talks, and sees nothing else. Never was a catastrophe so sudden - so complete - so full of horrible details. The weather is bad - cold - rain and even a little snow. <pb n="128"/></p>

        <p>We have plunged into the travail of dress making and shopping which seems almost heartless in this stunned and bereaved city. The daily details of this horrible accident grow worse and more harrowing. The whole civilized world stands aghast. The weather of yesterday repeats itself today, - rain, snow, and cold, cold winds. I am a little wretched - and so is <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>. <persName ref="#Boal_Terry">Terry Boal</persName> arrived today from <placeName ref="#Thonon">Thonon</placeName> - with his wife - having left the baby with his <persName ref="#Buttles_Sara">Aunt Sara</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis_Annie">Annie</persName> at their home in <placeName ref="#Thonon">Thonon</placeName>.

        <p>A week or more has gone by, with very little to chronicle, except continued bad and gloomy weather and constant shopping and sight seeing and wrestling with <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> dressmakers and milliners.

He has also stumbled upon a charmingly interesting <name type="object" ref="#The_Madonna_and_Child_before_a_red_curtain">painting of a Madonna and Child by that rare old Venetian painter the father of the Venetian school, <persName ref="#Vivarini_Bartolomeo">Bartolemmeo Vivarini</persName>. He saw it a few days ago at <persName ref="#Durand_Ruel_Paul">Durand-Ruel</persName>'s rooms - who had bought it with two or three old Italian daubs at an auction or sale from an old Paris family - he paid 400 dollars for it and evidently did not know its value. It was in a wretched condition - the panel warped and worm eaten. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> wanted it from the first and took me and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> to see it - we were charmed. <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> pronounced it excellent and when a day or two after <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> heard that the <placeName ref="#Louvre">Louvre</placeName> people were looking at it, he decided to buy it and have it transferred to canvas. He paid 1600 dollars for it. The Madonna is seated with the child on her knee - behind her a red curtain hung on a black cord, a gold background, beautifully dulled and reddened by time - signed - <pb n="130"/>

The weather was bright - but a cold north east wind blowing - so that it was a great contrast to our last visit there. There was a pleasant house party - especially an interesting old woman, <persName ref="#Ogle_Ms">Miss Ogle of Northumberland</persName> and we talked and walked about the park, and the terrace, and investigated the gardens - <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> sang to them in the evenings, to their great delight. There is such comfort and luxury in these English country houses. <persName ref="#Farrer_Gaspard">Gaspard Farrar</persName> came to dinner tonight. <pb n="131"/> Wednesday evening. May 26. We made our 3d visit to the <placeName ref="#National_Gallery">National Gallery</placeName> this morning - weather cold and threatening. We have found driving, even in the park, disagreeable. Busy shopping and seeing things. Last evening we dined at <persName ref="#Farrar_William_Sir">Sir William Farrars</persName> - and had a charming evening.  <persName ref="#Farrar_William_Sir">Sir William</persName> in spite of his age and infirmities very interesting and agreeable.

On Saturday <persName ref="#Fielding_Mr">Fielding</persName> and <persName ref="#Elwes_Cary_Gervase">Mr. Cary-Elwes</persName> came early, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> sang the <pb n="132"/> whole morning - they stayed to lunch, and most of the afternoon.
