                    &#8211; I got up and looked out at the interesting coast &#8211; reached

                        >France</placeName>! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired

                    in the most astounding state of decay &#8211; utter rottenness &#8211; they gave
                    damning evidence of neglect. I had never seen the <placeName ref="#Brittany"

                    olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that

                    donkeys, sheep and <pb n="81"/> goats &#8211; making the air thick with dust. It

                    so green and fragrant with their blossoming crops, and the birds singing
                    everywhere. The people were in their straw houses, which they build for watching
                    their crops &#8211; and it was very pastoral. Found a huge mail waiting for us.
