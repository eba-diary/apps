            <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <orgName ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">Emma B.
               Andrews Diary Project</orgName> include the transcription and digitization of a
               wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden Age' of Egyptian
               archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding
               partner of <orgName ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</orgName>

               and internships at the <orgName ref="#University_of_Washington">University of
                  Washington</orgName>.
               <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her
               association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities

               to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1913, she kept
               detailed journals of these voyages along the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName>,
               including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs

               <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the
               archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time, painting a revealing picture of
               the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the
               dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a
               broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information
               about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

          <p>We left home very regretfully on <<date when="1903-11-02">Nov. 2d</date> by the night boat. Spent four days in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> - sailed at 11 o'clock <date when="1903-11-07">Saturday Nov. 7th</date> on the <name type="boat" ref="#SS_Lahn">N. German Lloyd SS. Lahn</name>. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean Hardy</persName> joined us in <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName>, and is with us. Reached <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> at 3 o'clock today - 7 days and 15 hours from <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName>. Stopped to coal - and every one left the ship but 3 or 4 people. The Captain offered <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and me the bridge, where we were free from dust, and where our chairs and wraps were taken and we had a charming afternoon - so quiet and so high. The day was lovely - and we could enjoy the whole world as it lay spread before us. Under the friendly shelter of the awnings we had our tea - and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> napped - and when he wakened I read aloud - and we watched the sun go down over the <placeName ref="#Morocco">Morocco</placeName> Coast, with many lovely effects on sea and land: the sweetest of which was the bold hill on the <orgName ref="#Spanish">Spanish</orgName> side, with a wonderful colouring of russet green and crimson, and in the little valley below a white church and a group of buildings. A favourable passage - boat very comfortable - my two rooms so pleasant and comfy. We are due in <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> the morning of the <date when="1903-11-18">18th</date> - where we catch our steamer the <name  type="boat" ref="#Barbarossa">Barbarossa</name> for <placeName ref="Port_Said">Port Said</placeName>.</p>

          <p><!--This passage seems familar-->Arrived in due time at 7:30 this A.M. when the tender reached the deck, we found it densely packed with the <orgName ref="#Italian">Italian</orgName> steerage passengers - there were said to be 1000 of them. Through this steaming, reeking mass we found our way, piloted by two soldiers and <persName ref="Vickers_Mr">Mr. Vickers</persName><!--EBI-->; it was awful. I found one woman with a baby in her arms, almost fainting with fatigue - I took some of her things and she kept close behind me, and between us, the baby escaped pressure, and under our wing she entered the Custom House and I left her resting safely, wishing I had some restoratives to give her. But <persName ref="#Burgnoyne_Amelie">Amelie</persName> and my bag were far behind and unapproachable. Found letters and parcels for us at the <name type="hotel" ref="#Grand_Hotel">Hotel</name>. We are staying over night, the <name  type="boat" ref="#Barbarossa">Barbarossa</name> our boat not starting until tomorrow at 11 o’clock. Took <persName ref="#Hardy_Jearn">Jean</persName> to the <orgName ref="#National_Archaeological_Museum">Museo</orgName><!--correct museum?--> this morning. Found the Pompeian rooms closed - many repairs and changes, and great improvements going on. Weather very bad - tempestuous and heavy rains. <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName> not to be seen. We made a good run in the <name type="boat" ref="#SS_Lahn">Lahn</name> - and barring no deck cabins, were most comfy. This is our run - 361. 412. 396. 388. 405. 404. 410. 410. 411. 422 - then <placeName ref-"#Naples">Naples</placeName>, - the morning of the 11th day.</p>

          <p>A week of visiting and getting the boat ready. Among our fellow passengers on the <name  type="boat" ref="#Barbarossa">Barbarossa</name> were a <persName ref="#Dennis_Mr #Dennis_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Dennis</persName> coming out to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - he to devote himself to <orgName ref="#Egyptology">Egyptology</orgName>. They are from <placeName ref="#Baltimore">Baltimore</placeName> - youngish people and very nice. He has been preparing himself by study at the <orgName ref="#Johns_Hopkins_Univeristy">Johns Hopkins</orgName> - and his whole heart and soul are in it. He expects to join the Petrie camp. Also an <orgName ref="#English">English</orgName> family on board, <persName ref="#Lord_Clinton #Lady_Clinton">Lord and Lady Clinton</persName> - with a Doctor, a Mental Healer (whatever that is) but that is what they call the young woman who was constantly with <persName ref="#Lord_Clinton">Lord Clinton</persName>. He is an old man, and out of his mind, and seems to be unconscious of everything around him. They too, came to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> - and intend passing the winter at <placeName ref="#Aswan">Asw&#226;n</placeName>. The <persName ref="#Quibell_James #Quibell_Annie_Pirie">Quibells</persName> dined with us the other evening - and we lunched with them today - and met for the first time <persName ref="#Grenfell_Bernard">Dr. Grenfell</persName> and <persName ref="#Hunt_Arthur">Dr. Hunt</persName> - such interesting people always together in work and life. One is hardly mentioned without the other. There was also a <persName "#Mr_Loat">Mr. Loat</persName>, who lives near <placeName ref="#Oxford">Oxford</placeName> - and has been studying the birds and fishes of the <placeName ref="#Sudan">Soudan</placeName> for two or three years. He had the most entrancing stories about them, and hippos and all the <orgName ref="#African">African</orgName> animals. We sat in the little garden under a big tree, and stayed to tea. All our <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName> friends are gone up the river. <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> whom we saw on the <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name> the day before he sailed. He is going to join <persName ref="#Somers_Clarke_George">Somers-Clarke</persName> and some men at <placeName ref="#El_Kab">El Kab</placeName>, where they are going to thoroughly excavate this winter, being backed by <persName ref="#Phillips_Lionel">Lionel Phillips</persName>, the <orgName ref="#South_African">South African</orgName> millionaire. All the land about the site, has been conceded by the <orgName>Khedive</orgName> to a syndicate for developing nation - and whatever of interest and value remaining undiscovered on this very ancient ground, must be found and dug up, before this syndicate go to work there. The <persName ref="#Bird_Mr #Bird_Mrs">Birds on the <name type="boat" ref="#Zenet-el-Nil">Zenet-el-Nil</name> started up two weeks ago. <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName> still very ill - we think he ought to go to the Hospital - but all these natives are so afraid of the hospital.</p>

          <p>We have had a busy and anxious week. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> was not able to get up on Monday - and as she had not been quite herself since we landed I decided we ought to have the Doctor. Sent for <persName ref="Milton_Dr">Dr. Milton</persName> - who found her temperature <measure type="temperature">104</measure> - with great pains in the back and legs. He thought she ought to be very carefully watched for a day or two, as it was impossible to say what these symptoms might lead to - so in two hours after his visit, the room next hers was vacated, and a very presentable <orgName ref="#Englsih">English</orgName> nurse was established there. Fortunately the evening brought a violent fit of sickness, after which the fever left her, the night was good - she was decidedly better the next day, and continued improving. <persName ref="#Bowdon_Miss">Miss Bowdon</persName> proved such a good nurse and companion, that we begged her to stay her week out, and she is still here; it has been a great relief to me, and a help and comfort to <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean<persName>. <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> and she have been spending most of the day in the garden. We had however, one very anxious day - with the possibility of typhoid before us! At the dahabeah this afternoon - <persName ref="#Baroness_Trentenberg">Baroness Trentenberg</persName> <!--EBI--> came to tea - and young <persName ref="#Edgar_Mr">Mr. Edgar</persName> came in too. We lunched on Friday with the <persName ref="#Dennis_Mr #Dennis_Mrs">Dennis</persName>'s - <persName ref="#Lady_Clinton">Lady Clinton</persName> and her daughter being there. Unfortunately the good north wind which has been blowing ever since we arrived, stopped blowing yesterday - and the cold south wind has raged since. Yesterday <persName ref="#Lady_Clinton">Lady Clinton</persName> and her two daughters came in from the <name type="#Mena_House_Hotel">Mena House</name> and had tea with us on the <orgName ref="#Bedouin">Beduin</orgName>, and inspected the boat with much interest.</p>

The sunset was like the sun rise - only the whole heavens were swept as it were with rosy splashes which gave place to the light of the almost full moon.

He interested me very much talking of <orgName ref="#Coptic">Coptic</orgName><!--EBI--> - <orgName ref="#Byzantine">Byzantine</orgName> and <orgName ref="#Celtic">Celtic</name> Art- and told me about the <bibl type="book" ref="Book_of_Kells">"Book of Kells"</bibl><!--EBI--> of which I have never heard - and which I intend to investigate. The Encyclopedia which we have on board says, "that Kells (originally Keulis) is an ancient town of <placeName ref="#County_Meath">County Meath, Leicester, Ireland</placeName>,<!--EBI--> situated on the <placeName>Blackwater</placeName><!--??--> <measure type="distance">26 miles</measure> by rail from <placeName ref="Drogheda">Dragheda</placeName><!--EBI-->. Among several very interesting antiquities there, is the house of <persName type="historical" ref="St_Columba">St. Columba</persName><!--EBI-->, a round tower, and 3-4 stone crosses. <placeName ref="">Kells</placeName> was made the centre of a bishops see in 809 - this was united to the see of <placeName ref="#County_Meath">Meath</placeName> in the 13th century. A manuscript copy of the gospels called the <bibl type="book" ref="Book_of_Kells">Book of Kells</bibl>, is beautifully executed with coloured <orgName ref="#Celtic">Celtic</orgName> ornamentation, and is believed to be the work of the 9th century. It is now preserved in the <orgName "Trinity_College_Library">Library of Trinity College</placeName>, <placeName ref="#Dublin">Dublin</placeName>. <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> also told us of the work this year at <placeName ref="#El_Kab">El Kab</placeName>, where he has been most of the winter. It was intended to be exhaustive and to finish the excavation of this ancient site. They were disappointed in the results - shafts sunk in the temple, showed work of the 18 dynasty - under this, potteries of the III dynasty, showing a likeness to the so-called early <orgName ref="#Cretan">Cretan</orgName> forms - under these were found walls of pre-dynastic times. We get off tomorrow.</p>

          <p>A very busy day - <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName>, <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> and I went over early to <placeName ref="#Karnak">Karnak</placeName> to see the wonderful things <persName ref="#Legrain_M">Monsieur Le Grain</persName> has been finding lately. There is a "hole" one might say, perhaps 50 feet square, or more, which he discovered this year - it lies just at the corner formed by the <name type="historical" ref="Pylon_10">pylon of <persName type="historical" ref="Amenhotep_III">Amenhotep</placeName></name> , and the wall on which the <bibl type="poem" ref="#Pentaur">story of Pentaur</bibl> is written. Here he has found and been taking out all winter the most wonderful things. He showed me today a little exquisite statue in basalt - seated about a foot high, which he had taken out that morning, and which he told me was the 97th statue, big and little which he had taken out. It is more or less filled by infiltration, with water, and in this hundred or more <orgName ref="#Arab">Arabs</orgName> and boys were grubbing - and hauling up stones with tackle etc. Some splendid great stones with exquisitely wrought hieroglyphs and inscriptions of <persName ref="#Amenhotep_II">Amenhotep</persName> I have been taken out almost unbroken - and laid together, having probably formed a chapel of that king. It is supposed that in some dangerous emergency, all these things were concealed in this "cache" for they were not carelessly put there - and have come out almost unharmed. The most beautiful thing I ever saw of its kind in <orgName ref="#Egyptian">Egyptian</orgName> art, had been taken up to his own house - <persName ref="#Legrain_M">Le Grain</name>'s - a kneeling figure about 4 ft. high, in purest alabaster, and leaning with both hands on a stela. Its beauty, finish and modeling were almost <orgName ref="Greek">Greek</orgName>. It represents <persName type="historical" ref="">Ramses III</persName>. <persName ref="Legrain_M">Le Grain</name> has certainly had a wonderful success. Then we galloped madly back to town, for the donkeys are so fresh, and stopped at the <placeName>Murches</placeName> for a farewell visit, and a pleasant one. Then to the <name type="hotel" ref="#Luxor_Hotel" >Luxor Hotel</name> to ask the <persName ref="#Collins_Frances">Misses Collins</persName> to tea this afternoon - and <persName ref="#Coats_Mrs #Coats_Miss">Mrs. and Miss Coats</persName> - and home a little late for lunch. They all came and we had a pleasant afternoon. After they went, <persName ref="Livermore_Mr">Mr. Livermore</persName> <!--EBI-->of <placeName ref="#Boston">Boston</placeName> called - then came <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Mr. Carter</persName> - with latest news of the tomb - and finally said goodbye until he comes down to us at <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, and stays until we leave. This is the sketch of the burial chamber as it now is - tomorrow they begin to work on No. 5 - <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Mr. Carter</persName> thinks it may take until May to clear it entirely - and to get up the sarcophagi and other things. He reports these and a fine canopic box to be made of crystalline red sandstone, beautifully polished and inscribed. <!--[diagram of sarcophagus: page 32 of pdf]--> 	A.B. lid and sarcophagus of the Queen. C.D. lid and sarcophagus of <persName type="historical" ref="#Thotmes_I">Thotmes I</persName>. 	E.

We lunched as usual at <placeName>Mariettes</placeName> house on the terrace, which was dismally cold, and we were covered with sand. Unfortunately <persName ref="#Weigall_Arthur">Mr. Weigall</persName> who is working there had elected to go to <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> for the day, so we missed him. <persName>v.

          <p>I had such an uncomfortable night - and found on getting up at 6 this morning that a regular <name>Kamseen</name> was coming on. The air was so thick that I could dimly see the opposite side of the river - and the air was amazingly hot - dangerously so it seemed. Soon the wind began, and although we did not feel its full force on this side of the house, we got enough of its noise and dust. The portar told us they had never seen here a worse condition. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theo</persName> and I went down to the boat soon after breakfast, having had <persName>Billy</persName> up to breakfast, and I packed away all the <orgName>Hashepsut</orgName> deposits - I had intended going into town, but it was too hot - and I came back to the big, cool rooms which we have here. We have had them before - the <orgName>Khedivial</orgName> rooms - huge, lofty, magnificently furnished - but too big and grand for real comfort. Mrs. <persName>Metcalfe</persName> and <persName>Mr.</persName> and Mrs. <persName>Dennis</persName> came to lunch and one of the first things the latter told us was that Lord <persName>Clinton</persName> had died last night very suddenly. We feel such sympathy for <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> - but it surely is a mercy for them all. Mrs. <persName>Dennis</persName> said <persName>Lady C.</persName> was completely overcome. This evening a note from <persName ref="#Trefusis_Robert">Robert</persName> came confirming it. We all drove into town this afternoon shopped a little - had tea on the terrace at <placeName>Shepheards</placeName> - in all the noise and smells. <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> is rapidly thinning.

          <p>A dark, raining day - we went early to see my dear people at the <placeName>Villino,</placeName> and found them so happy to see us; we stayed to lunch, and until it was time to go to tea at <placeName>Costantini's,</placeName> which we had promised him yesterday we would do. <persName>Nettie</persName> went with us - and we had a very nice tea, with <persName>Pa Costantini</persName> present. They showed us the so-called <persName>Raphael</persName> portrait, a charming picture, but hardly the work of that great master. It might be by <persName>Guilio Romano.</persName> The picture has been signed, but the signature has been mostly obliterated. I never knew it to rain harder than it has most of the afternoon. Kept <persName>Nettie</persName> for dinner. Such a sad thing has occurred here this morning. <persName>Cecily Northcote,</persName> the young <orgName>English</orgName> girl who was staying with the <persName>Websters</persName> two summers ago in <placeName>Newport</placeName> and whom we know, a cousin of <persName>Farrers</persName> as well as the <orgName>Websters</orgName> - died with typhoid fever at the <placeName>Hotel de la Ville.</placeName> She came to <placeName>Italy</placeName> with <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Hamilton Fish Webster</persName> two months ago - they arrived from <placeName>Rome</placeName> 10 days ago, quite ailing, and today the whole thing was over for the poor young thing. She was only 18!</p>

The girls to lunch, a heavy thunder storm this afternoon - went early to the <placeName>Villino</placeName> and had tea - and stayed late. Am a little disturbed at <placeName>Lizie's</placeName> appearance - she looks ill. A lovely sight from my window last night just before going to bed. The rain had stopped, but the moon was breaking through the clouds, and reflected in the river; and made me think of the old song the words by <persName>Longfellow</persName> I think, which I used to sing hundreds of years ago, called "the <persName>Bridge",</persName> - the last lines of which run something like this. "And forever and forever, 	As long as the river flows, 	As long as life hath passions 	As long as life hath woes, 	The moon and her broken reflection, 	And the shadows shall appear - 	Like the image of love in heaven and its wavering image here.</p>

          <p>I thought best that <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> should have a rest today so we shopped and drove about, <persName>Nettie</persName> came to lunch, and we all, <persName>Lizzie</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName> included, went by invitation to Mrs. <persName>Newmans</persName> to tea - and had an enchanting visit. Their appartment at the top of an old palace in a quiet odd little piazza on the other side off the river, is filled with a wealth of lovely and choice things collected in a 30 years sojourn in <placeName>Italy</placeName> and Japan. I am always interested in these two people - so happily and quietly contented with themselves and each other - so busy, in a quiet way - and so surrounded by some if not most of the best things of life. It has poured with rain all the afternoon.</p>

          <p><persName>Mary</persName> came down, and went with us to <placeName>St. Croce</placeName> this morning. I never tire of this grand church - one of the most impressive I know. They are carefully washing off much of the whitewash from pillars and walls, seeking for frescoes.

          <p>I sent <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#Hardy_Jean">Jean</persName> to drive in the <placeName>Cascine</placeName> this morning - and I stayed at home. <persName>Mary</persName> to lunch. At 4 o'clock we drove out to Mrs. <persName>Gregory Smiths</persName> - at the <placeName>Villa Bella Riposa.</placeName> They bought this beautiful villa 3 years ago - it has an enchanting garden - with fine view. A charming afternoon, and some pleasant people. I was so interested in some things Mrs. <persName>Smith</persName> told us - about the house. After they had bought it, they were told of a remarkable thing by the people of whom they bought it - to which they did not give much attention at first, until they heard from a church dignitary (Mrs. <persName>Smith</persName> is <persName>Catholic)</persName> that it actually had occurred, and the whole story, trial and punishment was to be found in the Florentine Archives. One of the daughters of the house loved a man the family did not with her to marry - she became a nun - but excaped from the Convent and joined the man. She was afterwards found and with her child was taken home - the <persName>Cardinal</persName> came from <placeName>Florence</placeName> and presided at the trial, which took place in the great hall at which all of the family were present. She was walled up between the what is now drawing room and library - and found there by the people of whom the <name>Smiths</name> bought the house. She was bricked up to the shoulders, and her baby laid at her feet - when the <persName>Smiths</persName> had the drawing room redecorated, the place in the wall from which she was taken, could be seen - a ghastly history! At another part of the house we were shown a little stone staircase which led to the next floor, where it had been solidly walled up - it led below to a passage which they explored as far as the gate of the <orgName>Villa.</orgName> Along the terrace and in the garden I noticed some terra-cotta jars 3 ft. or more high, of a very peculiar shape. There were 50 of them found in a wall of great thickness which Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> was obliged to take down in his repairs. Altogether it is a most interesting house - but I don't think I would care for so many associations with the past in a house I lived in; so many human experiences, and such gruesome ones, would be intolerable to me. Better a clean present and a new house. A chapel and a sacristy form part of the house - from which the ancient dead however, have been removed.</p>
