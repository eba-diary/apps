            I have never known a stormier day - and it followed a night of roaring wind. It has
             rained without ceasing - and no one has been out. Yesterday was clearing, with clear
             skies, and a bracing Tramon-tana air that was delicious.

         <!-- are capo di monte and san martino hotels or places? -->
         <!-- should we tag waldorf astoria if it's only referring to a style and not a specific location? -->
         <!-- is it hotel splendid or splendide? -->
            We all had a fine drive this morning, and stopped at the
             <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_Splendid">Hotel Splendid</name>, one of <persName ref="#Bertalini_Mr">
            Bertalini</persName>'s hotels to see it. It is splendidly situated, almost on the level of
             <placeName ref="#Capodimonte">Capo di Monte</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#San_Martino">San Martino</placeName>. It has just been
             opened - and is very attractive. The <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> tram lands you
             just below the hotel, where a huge lift has been built straight through the rock -
             and you are carried straight up to the restaurant level, which is at the top of the
             house. We, however, preferred to drive to the entrance. The third floor of the
             hotel retreats far enough from the front of the two lower floors to give a very
             wide esplanade or terrace, running the whole length of the building, and giving
             the most fascinating view of the whole of that wonderful region - the city below,
             the sea, the islands and <placeName ref="#Vesuvius">Vesuvius</placeName>. The hotel is furnished quite
             in the <name type="hotel" ref="#Waldorf_Astoria">Waldorf Astoria</name> style heated by steam - and arranged
             with many appartments, so that you can have your own sitting room and dining room -
             bath rooms galore. We did not know the house was opened, or we would have stayed
             there. Just a little below the hotel, is a piece of property, consisting of a large
             courtyard, with a charming, rambling little house opening by many long windows to a
             little verandah on the terrace, and lovely garden terraces below. It is built in a
             childish, foolish fashion, simulating a ruined tower etc. but there was something
             attractive about. I wanted to buy at once - it was empty and unfurnished, but in
             very good order - an English lady having lived in it for 2
             years. We all adopted it. <persName ref="#Woodward_Dr">Woodward</persName> and
             <persName ref="#Bigelow_Mr">Bigelow</persName> as well as the rest of us - and call it our
             <name>Villa del Torre</name>. <persName ref="#Koon_Bessie">Bessie</persName> went off to
             <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> at 3 o'clock - a little sad - and
             <persName ref="#Woodward_Dr">Woodward</persName>, <persName ref="#Bigelow_Mr">Bigelow</persName>,
             <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">

            We have had fearful experiences since my last entry. The <name type="boat" ref="#Cleopatra_boat">Cleopatra</name> of the
             Austrian <orgName ref="#Lloyd">Lloyd Line</orgName> arrived at
             <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName> on time, and we were soon off, and found a gale
             outside waiting for us. It was very cold too. <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I
             went to bed at once to get warm, - the night was hideously rough. We did not get
             up until before dinner next evening, when we went to table - but only stayed
             through 3 courses. Hardly any one at table - the roof leaking - pools of water
             here and there, dishes smashing - moving about dangerous. We got back to our
             cabins as soon as possible and into our beds which we did not leave until 6 o'clock
             this morning, after we had succeeded in getting into harbour. The boat was
             indescribably dirty - cockroaches crawling over everything - no service - 2 old
             hags of stewardesses. The last night was really awful - I was quite worn out with
             trying to keep in bed - and the raging of the storm - the tons of water pouring
             upon the deck over my head - and the fact that we might not be able to get over
             the bar at the harbour, drove all sleep and rest away - we did get in however
             in a lull of the storm but the wind and rain began again as soon as we had
             landed. We caught the morning train, and arrived at noon - and are once more
             settled in our old rooms looking on the garden. We found
             <persName ref="#Tytus_Mrs">Mrs. Tytus</persName> and <persName ref="#Tytus_Bob">Bob</persName> here waiting for

            A busy week here, pushing on our preparations on the boat. It has been cold and
            rough - almost unprecedented weather it is said. But the good north wind has lately

             <name type="boat" ref="#Cleopatra_boat">Cleopatra</name>. A few hours after we landed, the
             <name type="boat" ref="#Messagrius">Messagrius</name> steamer trying to make a landing in the gale,
             fell foul of the <name type="boat" ref="#Cleopatra_boat">Cleopatra</name>, and crushed into her
             broadsides, literally cutting her in half - she sank in a few moments and now lies
             in the bottom of the harbour. No lives lost.

            getting in order in my room - About two we started with a very light wind - and made
            more or less progress. We passed the "<name type="boat" ref="#Seven_Hathors">Seven Hathor's</name>",
            <persName ref="#Wilbur_Mr">Mr. Wilbur</persName>'s old boat, and soon lost sight of her. Then
            the "<name type="boat" ref="#Safa">Sa &#8216;fa</name>" flying the English flag - both of which had started
            out sometime before us. Tied up for the night near

            A Heavy fog on the river this morning and did not get away until after 9 o'clock.
             The day has been warm and charming - we got on the sand about four o'clock and
             although worked hard until after 7, we did not get off, until the <name type="boat" ref="#Safa">Sa &#8216;fa</name>
             came up to us, and sent her men over to help us - when we were soon free - and

             tonight. This little home seems more charming than ever - its prettiness -

             Monday afternoon. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> had seen the boat several

            A cool bright day. We reached <placeName ref="#Jirjā">Girgeh</placeName> about 10 o'clock, and saw off
             in the desert opposite the house of <persName ref="#Reisner_George">Reisner</persName>, and the

             <persName ref="#von_Bissing_Baron"> v. Bissing</persName> went over, stayed to lunch and were not home until 3
             o'clock, when we went on, and drew up at the ugly high bank at

            We are all so tired tonight after our excursion to

             went over to <persName ref="#Petrie_William">Petrie</persName>'s camp - but the poor little beasts in my

             and the rain fell in torrents. I never saw such a storm before in

            Such a beautiful day - we started at 10 o'clock - for the other side

            The morning dawned in lovely fashion - and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I went on

            Again the same account. I have never known <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> like this.
             Every morning the ther. goes down to 50-52&#176; in my room and we have had no life
             on deck since we came. Our little stoves in daily use. <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>
             dined with us - always so pleasant - in spite of his dominant personality. His taste
             for all natural things is so charming to me and how he draws and paints. He is very
             much absorbed now in trying to bring on the trial of the thief who broke into the
             tomb, and robbed the body of the great <persName ref="#Amenhotep_III">Amenhotep III</persName>. The
             administration of justice is in this country administered in a very funny and
             desultory fashion. The thief of whose identity everyone is convinced, is at large on
             bail at the magnificent sum of [symbol] 1 and the film gaffirs, or watchmen who are
             suspected of complicity, are contentedly reposing in prison having now no work to do,
             and more to eat than they usually have and although <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> has
             offered [symbol] 100 to anyone who will tell him the truth, the natives stand in
             such fear of each other that they all swear total ignorance.
             <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>, who is Inspector of <placeName ref="#As_Said">Upper Egypt</placeName>
             has proved himself a most efficient officer - is absolutely fearless - carries no
             arms - and rides about quite unattended at all hours of the night.
             <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Sayce</persName> and his friends <persName ref="Ward_Mr">Mr. Ward</persName> dined also
             with us. I think we were all a little tired - for directly after breakfast we had
             started over to the <placeName ref="#Bībān al-Mulūk">Tombs of the Kings</placeName> &amp; I in my chair - in which
             I have had so comfortable a ride, as both donkeys went so well. It proved to be
             rather a bad day for the expedition, for the wind grew violent, and as 2 steamers
             were in port, we had two parties of tourists there - and every available lunch place
             being in use, <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> gave us permission to have our lunch table
             spread just behind the grille of the tomb now decided I believe to have been that of
             <persName ref="#Rameses_IV">Ramses IV</persName> where in great privacy and comfort we ate it; first,
             however, going with <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>
             into the raided <persName ref="#Amenhotep_III">Amenhotep III</persName> tomb - what a sad change we
             found! It has not been shown since the robbery, and <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">M. Maspero</persName>
             was to make his official examination of the body. No one but
             <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> and the head police officer had been in it. On his
             first visit <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> found certain footprints belonging to one
             pair of feet, which he instantly photographed, and on reaching home found they
             agreed perfectly with photos he had lately taken of suspected foot prints in
             another raided tomb - and on an official examination of the suspected man, these
             photos matched perfectly in lines and size, his feet! We found the coffin of
             cartonnage had been lifted from the sarcophagus, laid on the floor, and the
             wrappings ripped from the feet to the head - and in a state of utter ruin - and the
             mummy which had hidden on the boat, in a neighboring room, was smashed to pieces
             and the boat taken away. After a short glimpse of the wall paintings we climbed to
             the entrance, and to the light of day and fresh air - and then waited until the
             men had finished their examination. They reported that not the slightest thing of
             value - no inscription remained. That the king was quite majestic - reminding one
             of <persName ref="#Rameses_II">Ramses II</persName> - that his hair was brown, and parted in the
             middle! After lunch, <persName ref="#Maspero_Gaston">Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>
             walked about with <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> to fix upon the site of an
             exploration, which <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> under <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>
             is to make in the <placeName ref="#Bībān al-Mulūk">Valley of the Tombs</placeName>. The sky was threatening, and we then started
             for home. On coming out of the valley with its sheltering mountains we found a
             raging wind, the plain all one cloud of dust and sand, and
             <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName> hardly visible. We came home rapidly - how horrid it
             was - the shouting men - the galloping donkeys - the wind tearing my wraps off me
             - my hat hopelessly on the side of my head! Glad we were to get here - and to the
             ameliorating influences of hot water, brushes, and fresh clothes. The winds still rages.

            <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I went by appointment this morning to the
             <orgName ref="#American_College_for_Girls">American Mission School for girls</orgName>, which was established here this
             year. We took <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName> with us, as I want very much that she
             should go to this school. It is to be sure almost as if I should take a wild colt
             out of the fields and expect it to be satisfied and interested. We found a very
             good native house - new and large. With a really pleasant sitting room belonging to
             <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss Buchanan</persName> and her friend, also, who have charge of
             the school. <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss B.</persName> speaking very fluent Arabic asked
             <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName> if she would like to learn to read and write, and
             she promptly replied that "she wouldn't", and showed all her pretty white teeth in
             a merry smile. She further observed that she thought "those things would do for old
             ladies"! Then <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss B.</persName> asked "could she sew" - "No, she
             had never learned" - then, "would she like to learn to sew" "O very much". (I had
             already explained to <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss B.</persName> what a little savage she was).
             Then we went all through the school, saw the 5 different class rooms, in which the
             130 scholars are distributed - all very neat and most orderly.
             <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName> was much impressed with all this, and when she
             saw the long, pleasant dining room with its clean matting, its 3 tables, and neat
             dressers with nice looking dishes, she was delighted. At one of the tables the girls
             newly entered are put, where they eat in Arab fashion - at the others they are
             obliged to eat in civilized manner. They all take turn in preparing the tables,
             and in washing and cleaning the dishes and putting every thing in order afterwards.
             There are 10 boarders, who occupy 4 rooms - which we saw, - the beds were neat and
             simple, and good, with little white pillows and pink coverlids. Some of the girls
             who come from a distance, have their dinners at the school - and this was strong bait
             for my <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName>. Each morning the girls are marshalled in
             a row to pass inspection as to their cleanliness - and if they are not up to the mark,
             they are sent to a wash room to make themselves fit. The morning is occupied with
             lessons., - the afternoons with sewing and instruction in household duties. The
             scholars ranged from children of 5 to any age - one of the oldest being a widow with
             one child. We left <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName> with this widow - and she said she
             would begin her schooling the next morning. We will see. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>
             gave the school a nice piece of ground beyond the Catholic Church for a place for their new school
             house last year - and we intend giving to the building fund. Then we went to pay a
             visit to the <persName ref="#Murch_Chauncey #Murch_Mrs">Murches</persName> - where
             <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> talked affairs with <persName ref="#Murch_Chauncey">Mr. Murch.</persName>
             <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and the <persName ref="#Quibell_James #Quibell_Annie_Pirie">Quibells</persName>
             went over quite early this morning to <placeName ref="#Sheikh Abd el-Qurna">Abd el Kurnah</placeName> to see
             the private tombs under <persName ref="#Newberry_Percy">Newberry</persName> and to lunch with him -
             and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> and I went across the river at 3:30 with
             the tea basket to <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName>'s <placeName ref="#Castle_Carter">house</placeName> - where the rest
             joined us - and we all rode home together - the warmest day we have had for weeks.

             very ill with dysentery - and that she had to return to <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>
             that night - and so she cannot go with us to <placeName ref="#Aswan">Aswan</placeName>
             as she intended to her great disappointment. We were all most dismal over it. Then
             <persName ref="#Tytus_Mrs">Mrs. Tytus</persName> came - and we sat chatting on the deck most
             of the morning, saying how nice it was to have it warm. Then I wrote letters.
             <persName ref="#Tytus_Mrs">Mrs. Tytus</persName> came to tea, and the <persName ref="#Quibell_James #Quibell_Annie_Pirie">Quibells</persName>

             to go with us in her place - he being yet too weak from illness to go to work again

             to lunch, and to play chess - and after <persName>Mr. and

             <persName>Hassan</persName>'s mother came, attended by the old man, and her
             nephew. We would like to have had the former kicked off the boat; but knew that he

             have to live on for 6 months - even if she succeeds in keeping it out of his
             clutches - and 2 shawls - and tins of biscuit and sweet things, and soap - and
             everything we could think of - and she had brought us 2 chickens, some dates and
             eggs. We hated to keep them, but could not decline. Then <persName ref="#Yemma">

            A strong north wind was blowing as usual this morning - and we had quite given up
             starting, when just after lunch it dropped so much that we started - but had only got
             opposite the <placeName>Grenfell Mt.</placeName> when we had to tie up to a little

             little squalls breaking over us now and then. But the night is so wonderful - the air

             moon so bright, and all the electric lights of <placeName ref="#Aswan">Aswan</placeName> making a

             brought us at 6:30 to within 3 miles below <placeName>Sileilis</placeName>. I have been very little on deck
             the heat was so intense - The <name type="boat" ref="#Scarab">S.S. Scarab</name> passed us about 10 o'clock
             - they flew by us - and we had only a glimpse of them. The <name type="boat" ref="Hathor">Hathor</name>

             alabaster canopic jars and other things with fine hieroglyphs and one strange black
             scarab of good size. For the first time the new electric light was turned on the tomb

            <!-- Schuylers - are they the phillips schuylers, or someomne new? -->
            A very warm morning - <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I went

            see <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> - who is a prisoner with a bad foot. He

            Scarab</name> to see <persName ref="#Tytus_Mrs">Mrs. Tytus</persName>. The wind was strong
             and air delicous as we rowed up the river again - but as we left the <name type="boat" ref="#Scarab">
            Scarab</name>, it had increased almost to a hurricane , and looking back to where
             the <name type="boat" ref="#Istar">Istar</name> is lying opposite <placeName ref="#Luxor">Luxor</placeName>,
             with the <name type="boat" ref="#Strange_Hathor">Strange Hathor</name> and the steamer <name type="boat" ref="#Oonas">

             up the river and stopped just in front of us, at 4 o'clock this afternoon we went
             across to have tea with <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> - such a pleasant visit -
             <persName ref="#Newberry_Percy">Newberry</persName> was there - we had tea as usual on the terrace
             and the young donkey <name type="animal" ref="#San_Toy_Donkey">San Toy</name> was roaming about the compound
             - and much interested in us. <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter</persName> showed us some of his
             beautiful drawings before we left. It was past 6 o'clock when we reached home, and
             <persName ref="#Buchanan_Carrie">Miss Buchanan</persName> was here - and we settled about
             <persName ref="#Nubia">Nubia</persName> - who after 3 weeks now at school shows such
             aptitude and cleverness that she is to live there. As her father and mother are dead,
             and she has only a precarious home with a married sister, I do not hesitate about this
             - and the girl herself seems delighted.

             then grew stronger, in the face of which we have rowed and floated all day and are
             lying below <placeName ref="#Magadah">Magadah</placeName> about 2 miles - having made 24 miles. I

             Scarab</name> passed us. It was too early to see any one, as we were
             all in bed, and I fancy they were. We have had a great change of temperature - and
             it is really cold.

            We made these by starting at 4 o'clock but were laid up by the wind at a bank near the

             <placeName ref="#Manfalût">Manfalout</placeName>. Since then the wind has raged, and is
             still roaring and whistling. S.S. "Rameses the Great" and "Tewfih" passed down - and
             the dahabeah "Hope", german flag, with a tug.

            We had a great gale last night, and today has been really cold with not a gleam of

             and waited for the wind to fall - started again after some hours, and have come just
             one more mile making in all 4 miles. It has been threatening rain all day, and some
             drops did fall this afternoon - but the sky is very overcast this evening.

            Our best day - got away early from the landing near <placeName ref="#Manfalût">

             - got past the <persName ref="#Gebel_Abu_Foda">Gebel Abu-Feda</persName> by 11 o'clock, in
             fortunately quiet weather. Came across the "<placeName>Sa'fa</placeName>"
             hard and fast upon the sand at one o'clock - dropped anchor and sent our men across to
             help them, and in less than an hour they were off. The day has been a great contrast
             to yesterday - very <persName>Khamseeny</persName>- very hot - the sky
             overclouded. From 5 o'clock after we had had our tea on deck, until we tied up, it was
             something especially lovely. No sun, and that subdued stillness that seems to belong
             to such a condition, - almost a feeling of rain in the air - the mild breeze carried
             us smoothly and mysteriously along, the flocks and herds all coming down to the river
             for their last drink, the little kids and lambs now so plentiful, crying out like
             babies - "and all the land had rest". It was a heavenly evening. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">

            Came along splendidly in quiet weather until 12:30 when we were forced to the bank by

            A very good record for such a day of continued n. wind. We have not once tied up, but

             <placeName ref="#Maghaghah">Maghagah</placeName>. We passed 5-6 miles from here one of the

             hard upon the sand with many gyassas about her, filled with her cargoe. Soon after,
             she got off. The Anglo-American steamer has pulled in
             ahead of us - the last big steamer on the river, I think. The afternoon had such
             strange, unrivalled beauty. We passed the town of <placeName ref="#Sharona">

            A farewell visit to the boat today - and to the <persName ref="#Quibell_James #Quibell_Annie_Pirie">

             and stayed late. This morning we went with him to see the new Museum - which looks
             like a good station more than a Museum - a hideous failure.

             <name type="boat" ref="#Isis">SS. Isis</name>, looking so pretty and trim - not many passengers -
             most of them arriving on the "<name type="boat" ref="#India_boat">India</name>" from
             <placeName ref="#Australia">Australia</placeName> at midnight, for whose mail we waited.
             The first day and night were quite perfect - good weather and smooth seas - and we
             went to bed quite hoping that these unusual conditions would prevail the next day,
             through the <placeName ref="#Aegean_Sea">Aegean Sea</placeName> and islands - but at 7
             o'clock we encountered a fearful storm, and the last 24 hours were diabolical. I have
             never known anything like it since many years ago we crossed from
             <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Constantinople">
             Constantinople</placeName>! Reached <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName>
             <date when="1902-04-10">Thursday</date> 6 A.M. and found the <placeName ref="#London">
             London</placeName> through train de luxe waiting at the landing - and we soon were in
             the admirable sleeping car, with dining room attached. We had a double and a single
             compartment to ourselves and were most comfortable. From <placeName>
             Faggie</placeName> on, the route was unfamiliar to us - and all the way to
             <placeName ref="#Ancona">Ancona</placeName>, it was by the sea shore, -- the day was
             fine, delicious air, fragrant with apple and pear blossoms - the sea, liquid turquoise
             - and the hoary, old battlemented towns on their heights, with their towns, cathedrals,
             castles - the picturesque little fishing villages - the wide desolate plains - the
             richly cultivated fields - the roadsides brilliant with flowers of every colour, with
             poppies predominating - and towards the later afternoon, the snow covered peaks of the
             <placeName ref="#Appennin_Abruzzese">Abruggi Mountains</placeName> showing - and the fishing
             fleets coming home - with their orange, red, cinnamon coloured, sails so diversely
             painted, that they had the air of huge butterflies resting on the water - all made a
             scene of ravishing beauty, that one is thankful to remember. We reached
             <placeName ref="#Bologna">Bologna</placeName> at midnight, and are established in the
             familiar rooms of this fine old hotel, where we have been twice before. It is and has
             been dull and rainy since we arrived - not a glint of sunlight. Each day has been busy
             - on <date when="1902-04-11">Friday</date> we went to the <placeName ref="#Gallerie_dell_Accademia">Academia</placeName>, and stayed the
             morning - saw two lovely <persName ref="#Francia_Francesco">Francias</persName>, the incomparable
             [illegible] (Madonna enthroned) <placeName ref="#Raphael's_Saint_Cecilia">Raphael's St. Cecilia</placeName>,
             which one seems to care for less and less - the more one sees it - a fine
             <persName ref="#Gabriel_Loppé">Loppe</persName>. There are really few things of paramount
             worth in this gallery. In the afternoon it rained, and we all stayed indoors.
             <date when="1902-04-12">Saturday</date>, yesterday we went to <placeName ref="#San_Petronio">
             S. Petronio</placeName> - interesting but disappointing. The most interesting thing to
             me, were the 4 rude stone crosses, supposed to have been erected by
             <persName ref="#Petronius">Petronius</persName>, Bishop of
             Bologna, near the old gates in the V Century. The best were the sculptures
             outside the church, which we could not well see, because of the rain and wet - a
             beautiful <persName ref="#Francia_Francesco">Francia</persName> in one of the chapels. Then to the
             church of <placeName ref="#San_Domenico">S. Dominico</placeName> - which contains the body of
             the saint who died here - a sarcophagus or "area" by <persName ref="#Nicola_Pisano">
             Nicola Pisano</persName> and pupils - beautiful in detail but clumsy in effect
             architecturally. Two or three good figures standing on it - and 2 angels holding
             candlesticks, the one to the left quite lovely by <persName ref="#Nicola_dell'Area">
             Nicola dell'Area</persName> - the angel on the right and the <persName ref="#Petronius">
             S. Petronius</persName> with the church in his hand are said to have been by
             <persName ref="#Michelangelo">Michaelangelo</persName>. In the vestibule a monument of
             <persName ref="#Alessandro_Tartagni">Tartagni</persName>, jurist, by <persName ref="#Francesco_di_Simone">
             Francesco di Simone</persName>. The Piazzo outside
             called Galileo, is very pretty and picturesque -
             with two columns bearing statues of <persName ref="#Saint_Dominic">S. Dominico</persName>
             and the <persName>Madonna</persName>, and two important monuments of the
             XIII Cent. on columns, - the one belonging to the family <persName>
             Fascherari</persName> is very interesting because of an elegant work of the
             <orgName>VIII C.</orgName> an arc of a ciborium applied to the tomb - a
             rich archivolt with foliage, in the corners 2 peacocks in rather coarse work.
             <persName ref="#Carlo_Cattaneo">Cattaneo</persName> pronounces this to be "veritable and pure
             remains of the antique. Then to the church of <placeName ref="#San_Giacomo_Maggiore">
             S. Giacomo Maggiere</placeName>, where in the <objectName ref="#Cappella_Bentivoglio">Capella
             Bentivoglie</objectName> is one of the finest paintings of
             <placeName ref="#Francia_Francesco">Francia</placeName> - <persName>Madonna</persName>
             with saints - the child almost the same as the one in <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">
             Theodore</persName>'s pictures - and the <persName>Madonna</persName>
             very like - lovely - outside the chapel, the monument of <persName ref="#Antonio_Dontiveglio">
             Antonio Dontiveglio</persName> by <persName ref="#Jacopo_della_Quercia">Jacopa
             della Quercia</persName> - with beautiful figures of the virtues - the Oratory of
             <persName ref="#Saint_Cecilia">S. Cecilia</persName> with frescoes by <persName ref="#Francia_Francesco">
             Francia</persName>, <persName ref="#Lorenzo_Costa">Costa</persName>, <persName ref="#Amico_Aspertini">
             Aspertini</persName> - those of <persName ref="#Francia_Francesco">Francia</persName> quite
             lovely. After lunch we went to the <placeName ref="#Museu_Civico">
             Museu Civioco</placeName>, where we were intensely interested in the
             Etruscan and Egyptian
             remains - and the exquisite "Head" supposed to be a copy from the bronze original of
             <persName ref="#Phidias">Pheidias</persName> - stopped on coming home at a shop near
             here and bought some beautiful embroideries on linen, native Bolognese work - and also
             visited <placeName ref="#San_Vitale">San Vitale</placeName>, or the
             "Seven Churches" most interesting - but gloomy, and cold. This morning I went
             for a drive to a <placeName ref="#Villa_Revedin">Villa Revedin</placeName>, belonging
             to a <persName>Ferrara</persName> family of that name - very high with
             fine views of the town, and the level, flat plain beyond. The grounds were pretty with
             some fine trees - and some wonderful Wistaria vines coming into flower - a large
             pergola, walls, terraces covered with them - a great terrace in front of the house -
             which must be charming - then to the Park - which was not good. Today has been a local
             festa day - with banners flying - and crowds filling the streets, and a fine procession
             bearing a <persName>Madonna</persName> from one church to another.
             Italian religious functions possess such incongruities and I always wonder if they are
             not apparent to the populace and priests. We go to <placeName ref="#Florence">
             Florence</placeName> tomorrow.

            We arrived last evening at 7 o'clock - being an hour late. A very pleasant day's
             journey, though there were some unpropitius moments at the railway station, when we
             found in all the hurry and crowd that a lot of noisy Germans had appropriated our
             reserved compartment - great vociferation and indignation on the part of the
             <placeName>Capodi Stagieni</placeName>, when he discovered it; but it
             did not avail to dislodge the rude intruders - so the train was held, until a fresh car
             could be brought up, which was fresh, clean and convenient and which we had entirely to
             ourselves. Found <persName ref="#Koon_Bessie">Bessie</persName> and <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">
             Mary</persName> waiting at the station. This morning we spent at the
             <placeName ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Uffissi</placeName> - and afternoon at the
             <persName ref="#Constantini_David#Constantini_Mrs.">Constantini</persName>'s and at tea at <persName ref="#Buttles_Lizzie">

             Paris</placeName> - we have had a charming stay here. The weather has been beautiful,
             and I have been perfectly well - delightful combination indeed! We have seen the
             beautiful pictures, marbles and statuary and churches, seen all our friends - made many
             visits - received many. Last Sunday we drove up to "<placeName ref="#Villa_I_Tatti">
             I Tatti</placeName>" to lunch with the <persName ref="#Abbott_Senda_Berenson#Berenson_Bernard">Berensons</persName>
             in their charming villa - two pleasant Englishmen also to lunch. The old house with its
             corridors, stately rooms, pretty courts and gardens and the little chapel is entirely
             interesting and charming - and the whole world of <placeName ref="#Florence">
             Florence</placeName> is seen below it. This morning <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName>
             went about with me for half an hour, and then we drove, in spite of threatening clouds,
             to <placeName ref="#San_Miniato">San Miaiato</placeName>. We had it quite to ourselves -
             and after coming out of the church, we hung over the parapet of coarse and looked at
             <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> as she winds her lovely length through
             the plain - and at the great shadows of the clouds on the mountains. The young

            We had a charming and not at all tiring ride from <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence
            </placeName> yesterday - and I was so pleased to see again the rich, level lands of
             <placeName ref="#Venetia">Venetia</placeName> - with their slender minarets, and
             ancient cities - and to have sight again of the lagoons, and opalescent waters, and the
             city of all others, rising from them, with the setting sun burnishing its towers and
             buildings. We are in the same princely apartment of two years ago, and we found
             <persName ref="#Clarke_Miss">Phoebe</persName> and <persName ref="#Doctor_Clarke">Dr. Clarke</persName>
             here. This morning we went to <placeName ref="#San_Francesco">S. Francesco</placeName> to
             see the <objectName ref="#Antonio_Falier_da_Negroponte">Negroponte</objectName> beautiful <persName>Madonna</persName>,
             and to <placeName ref="#Santa_Maria_Formosa">S. Maria Formosa</placeName>, to see especially a painting
             in the sacristy of a <persName>Madonna</persName> and Child by
             <persName ref="#Pietro_da_Messina">Pietro da Messina</persName> - the artist by whom was
             painted a very charming Madonna <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName>
             bought in <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName>. It was very like - and
             was a signed picture. Then we went to the great <placeName ref="#Giovanni_o_Paola_Church">
             Giovanni o Paola Church</placeName> - and looked at its monuments and pictures and
             studied its effects - and home for lunch. In the afternoon <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">
             Theodore</persName> and I went to <persName ref="#Berozzo">Berozzo</persName>'s and
             after we met the girls, and <persName ref="#Clarke_Miss">Phoebe</persName> and
             <persName ref="#Doctor_Clarke">Dr. Clarke</persName> in the piazza and had tea - and the
             rain came down, and we had to go inside the cafe. Then we brought up at
             <placeName ref="#Orcania">Orcania</placeName>'s the publishers, and quite late, dodged
             the showers and got home. This morning we went to <persName ref="#Berozzo">
             Berozzi</persName>'s atelier and saw some lovely frames, and a casom - which
             <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> bought. The rest of the morning we spent at
             the <placeName ref="#Gallerie_dell_Accademia">Academia.</placeName> This afternoon we went to see
             the <persName ref="#Benson_Mr">Benson</persName>'s - and found them as usual - such a
             sufferer and cripple as she is! and so cheerful and interesting!
             <persName ref="#Clarke_Miss">Phoebe</persName> and <persName ref="#Doctor_Clarke">Dr. Clarke</persName>

            A very busy day - with churches, pictures etc. A large part of the morning at the

             and I brought up at <placeName ref="#St_Marks_Campanile">St. Marks</placeName> at 4:30 - after
             having had tea on the Piazza; the church was
             glorious, a little too late to see all the details, but the effect wonderful - for all
             the dim harmony of colour of the church leads up to the splendour of the high altar,
             where the <objectName ref="#Pala_d'Oro">Pala d'Oro</objectName> was shining - like a rich high

            Another busy day - with the delights of <placeName ref="#Venice">Venice</placeName> -
             <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> has bought a really beautiful statue of
             the <persName>Madonna</persName> and Child - except for the difference of
             material and size it reminds one of the old French ivory statuettes - the leaning
             Virgin and child. It came from a suppressed convent in <placeName ref="#Verona">
             Verona</placeName> - and is claimed to be by one of <persName ref="#Nicola_Pisano">Pisanos</persName>.
             He has also bought some lovely frames and a cassone from <placeName ref="#Bergeggi">Bereggi</placeName>.

            Left <placeName ref="#Venice">Venice</placeName> this morning, 2 P.M. most reluctantly, and
             arrived here at <placeName ref="#Verona">Verona</placeName>, <name type="hotel" ref="#Hotel_de_Londres">Hotel
             de Londres</name>, at 5:30. Our hotel is comfortable enough - not cheerful - and very
             frigid. The town looks tremendously interesting - <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName>
             and I walked a short distance from here and found the <placeName ref="#Scaliger_Tombs">
             Scaliger tombs</placeName> - the great square of <placeName ref="#Piazza_della_Signoria">Signoria</placeName>,
             the ancient palace of the <placeName ref="#Palazzo_del_Podestà">Padesta</placeName> - many curious
             and ancient forms of architecture and home by the busy and quaint
             <placeName ref="#Piazza_d'Erbe">Piazza d'Erhe</placeName>, now a market.

            We are off for <placeName ref="#Duomo_di_Milano">Milan</placeName> this afternoon - have found <placeName ref="#Verona">
            Verona</placeName> delightfully interesting. Spent yesterday at the
             <placeName ref="#Uffizi_Gallery">Gallery</placeName>, where there are some good things - and
             then went to the great old church of <persName ref="#Basilica_di_San_Zeno">S. Zeno</persName>, about
             which I had read and know from photographs - wonderful bronze doors - carvings - grand
             effects - mediaeval features. <persName ref="#Andrea_Mantegna">Mantegna</persName>'s
             great enthroned Madonna and Saints - which
             <persName ref="#Napoleon_Bonaparte">Napoleon</persName> kindly conveyed to <placeName ref="#Paris">
             Paris</placeName>, but which was returned afterwards to <placeName ref="#Italy">
             Italy</placeName>. After lunch, to the <placeName ref="#Duomo_di_Milano">Duomo</placeName>
             - Baptistry - wonderful Roman pavement, discovered
             under the cloister and then for a fine drive into the country - with all
             <placeName ref="#Verona">Verona</placeName> and its surroundings - and the splendid

            A charming ride from <placeName ref="#Verona">Verona</placeName> on Friday - with the chain of
             the snow covered <placeName ref="#Tyrolean_Alps">Alps</placeName> with us all the way - arrived at
             7:30 - found our old rooms in readiness - fire - dinner table all ready, with its
             shining silver, and spotless linen. This is certainly the best and most comfortable
             hotel in Europe! We spent all day yesterday in stony galleries - the morning at the

             <persName ref="#Visconti_family">Viscontis</persName> and <placeName ref="#Sforza_family">Sforzas</placeName>
             - enormously interesting - I saw for the first time the beautiful monument of
             <persName ref="#Gaston_de_Foix">Caston de Foix</persName> - and so many charming and
             interesting sculptures - afterwards we had a drive. <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr.

             came to dine. This morning it rained and was cold, and I stayed at home, with

            We had the most beautiful day yesterday - most of the morning at the
             <placeName>Poldo-Pezzoli</placeName> - left <placeName ref="#Duomo_di_Milano">Milan</placeName>
             at 12:30 in 2 comfortable compartments. The afternoon was warm, even hot - and we were
             glad to get into the shade of the big <placeName>St. Gotthard</placeName>
             tunnel. What was our astonishment to find on emerging from it, the snow falling fast
             and continuously. We drew up at the station of <placeName>G&#246;sechnen</placeName>,
             and had some of their excellent coffee, which was handed into the windows to us - then
             began such a beautiful sight - the mountains, trees, ground, every blade and branch
             laden with snow - making a delightful fairy land - the great fires climbing up the
             steep mountain sides, with their pointed white tops looked positively eerie. The snow
             changed to rain as we reached the valley level - but a wonderful sunset promised a fine
             morrow which promise sadly was not fulfilled - for it has rained most of the day - and
             has been very cold. No one but <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore</persName> went out
             -and no views of the mountains - hardly of the lake. We are off at 7 A.M. tomorrow for
             <placeName>Paris</placeName>.

             came to say goodbye before we left, and <persName>Mathilde</persName> brought

             <persName>Fielding</persName> lunched with us yesterday -
             <persName>Gaspard Farrer</persName> turned up on Monday - and asked

             and had a jolly time - old <persName>Sir William</persName> was there,

             except the prices! We have a charming apartment on the 4th floor above the neighboring
             chimney pots - and we actually see the sunset from our windows. Everything is new,

            We arrived safely yesterday at 7 o'clock P.M. being the evening of the 8th day of the
             voyage - the longest <placeName>N. Atlantic</placeName> crossing I have
             made for years. The "<name>St. Louis</name>" was a very comfortable
             boat but not a fast one - I had a charming deck room, with private bath room - and as
             it was cold, gray and damp - I stayed in my room - most of the time in bed. We cannot
             get rooms on Monday's boat - and are obliged to stay over for Tuesday morning - vexing!
