          <p>Established in 2010, the goals of the <orgName ref="#Emma_B_Andrews_Diary_Project">Emma B. Andrews Diary Project</orgName> include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the'Golden Age' of Egyptian archaeology at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. A founding partner of <orgName ref="#Newbook_Digital_Texts">Newbook Digital Texts</orgName> (www.newbookdigitaltexts.org), the <orgName ref="#EBA_Diary_Project">EBA Diary Project</orgName> offers undergraduate and graduate digital humanities education and internships at the <orgName ref="#University_of_Washington">University of Washington.</orgName> <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore_M">Theodore M. Davis</persName>. Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages along the <placeName ref="#Nile">Nile</placeName>, including his important yet under-reported excavations of over 20 significant tombs in the <placeName ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley of the Kings</placeName>. <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time, painting a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in at the dawn of the twentieth century. Analysis of the content of her diaries, along with a broad range of additional primary source material, will afford scholars information about important historical resources for the first time.</p>

          <p>We left home very regretfully on Nov. 2d by the night boat. Spent four days in <placeName>New York</placeName> - sailed at 11 o'clock Saturday Nov. 7th on the <orgName>N. German</orgName> Lloyd SS. <persName>Lahn.</persName> <persName>Jean Hardy</persName> joined us in <placeName>New York,</placeName> and is with us. Reached <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName> at 3 o'clock today - 7 days and 15 hours from <placeName>New York.</placeName> Stopped to coal - and every one left the ship but 3 or 4 people. The Captain offered <persName>Theodore</persName> and me the bridge, where we were free from dust, and where our chairs and wraps were taken and we had a charming afternoon - so quiet and so high. The day was lovely - and we could enjoy the whole world as it lay spread before us. Under the friendly shelter of the awnings we had our tea - and <persName>Theo.</persName> napped - and when he wakened I read aloud - and we watched the sun go down over the <placeName>Morocco Coast,</placeName> with many lovely effects on sea and land: the sweetest of which was the bold hill on the <orgName>Spanish</orgName> side, with a wonderful colouring of russet green and crimson, and in the little valley below a white church and a group of buildings. A favourable passage - boat very comfortable - my two rooms so pleasant and comfy. We are due in <placeName>Naples</placeName> the morning of the 18th - where we catch our steamer the <name>Barborossa</name> for <placeName>Port Said</placeName>.</p>

          <p>Arrived in due time at 7:30 this A.M. when the tender reached Washington! I could not credit it, and went with the startling news to <persName>Theodore,</persName> who had not noticed it. And so our bright day was turned into sadness - and our thoughts have since been with dear Mrs. <persName>Proctor,</persName> there was such devotion between them - and their last visit to us in October was so pleasant - and since then I have had several letters from him - his strong, genial, sympathetic presence was always so delightful. We think too of young <persName>John</persName> in the <placeName>Phillipines</placeName> so far from his mother at this time. We have been writing letters to them this evening.</p>

          <p>I looked out of my window at 6:30 this morning and saw the sun just rising out of a clear crimson sky - not a vapour or cloud - just a big pink ball. But it was on the wrong side of the boat! As we were making the big loop between the <placeName>Gebel</placeName> et-Teekh, and the <orgName>Gebel et Tarif</orgName> just before <persName>Nag Hamadi</persName> and we were pointed almost north. The day has been endlessly beautiful - very warm - hardly a breath of wind - and the silent, gentle progress we made through the exquisite colouring - no sound except occasionally the distant minor chant of a shadoof worker. The sunset was like the sun rise - only the whole heavens were swept as it were with rosy splashes which gave place to the light of the almost full moon. No words can do justice to the beauty of such a day.</p>

It is just south of <placeName>Hatshepsut's</placeName> temple, and like it in its leading features - with rising terraces and colonnades - and the retaining wall runs almost parallel to here. Some beautiful objects have been found and very good work. <persName>Mr. Sayce</persName> came to lunch - and Mr. <persName>Carter</persName> in the evening to stay with us. We heard the details of the work in the <placeName>Hatshepsut</placeName> tomb. The last two months have been very difficult, as the rock was so hard - not more than one meter's progress possible in a day - and each meter under these conditions costing Â£3. a day!</p>

          <p>Mr. <persName>Newberry</persName> lunched with us. The <name>Frasers</name> came to see us - I had gone over there the other day with Mr. <persName>Newberry</persName> to see them, on their boat "the Strange Hathor". I had always wanted to see this boat, it has such a singular exterior. THey are known among their friends as the "mad hatters" (Mr. and Mrs. Fraser.) The saloon was quite charming - an L-shaped room - the walls from floor to ceiling either covered with books, pictures, embroideries, mushrabya work, faience, etc. In one corner a tiny grate, with a fire burning - two doors (outside) opening on a narrow way which runs along the side of the boat - and these are sliding glass doors - and inside mushrabya doors. They have pre-empted or leased the river bank for the length of the boat - the have planted this bank, and the open door made it seem like a country cottage, looking on to a garden. As Mr. <persName>Fraser</persName> is a government official and lives here all the year, this sort of a thing is worth his while. They were however immensely pleased with the <orgName>Beduin.</orgName> <persName>Theodore</persName> took <persName>Jean</persName> to the races - and brought back the <placeName>Sargents</placeName> from <placeName>Boston</placeName> for tea.</p>

          <date when="">Tuesday, Feb. 2d. <persName>Jean, Robert</persName> and I went over to <persName>Carters</persName> to dine and see <persName>Medinet Habou</persName> by moonlight. It was quite too beautiful. The full moon rose just after we got into the plain. The dinner was good - and afterwards the rest walked, I on my donkey, to <placeName>Medinet</placeName> - and walked about it. The others went to the top of the pylon - while I sat at its foot in the big outer court and enjoyed the beauty of it all. I think its great pylon and its proportions the finest in Egypt. <persName>Carter</persName> rode home with us, at least to the sands. Theo. still has a cold, and did not venture out.</p>

They stopped a moment on passing, to get some things I gave them - some tinned tongues, cheese, jame etc. They looked very jolly as they went off - with an <orgName>American</orgName> flag at their mast. <persName>Theo Jean</persName> and <persName>Robert</persName> with <persName>Mr. Newberry</persName> went to see <persName>Hui's</persName> tomb, and stopped for tea with <persName>Carter.</persName> The reports from tomb today, tell of the tunnel being made from end to end in the big chamber filled with the debris of fallen ceilings etc. and no passage found - they begin tomorrow on right hand side, hoping to find an outlet. It now takes just 20 minutes steady climbing from the entrance to this chamber to the mouth of the tomb - there is not one foot of level space <persName>Carter</persName> says in the whole corridor - and as it is over 700 ft. long and has a depth of 350 ft. it is enough to daunt the stoutest heart. [page jump - page 2:] the deck, we found it densely packed with the <orgName>Italian</orgName> steerage passengers - there were said to be 1000 of them. Through this steaming, reeking mass we found our way, piloted by two soldiers and Mr. <persName>Vickers;</persName> it was awful. I found one woman with a baby in her arms, almost fainting with fatigue - I took some of her things and she kept close behind me, and between us, the baby escaped pressure, and under our wing she entered the <placeName>Custom House</placeName> and I left her resting safely, wishing I had some restoratives to give her. But <persName>Amelie</persName> and my bag were far behind and unapproachable. Found letters and parcels for us at the <orgName>Hotel.</orgName> We are staying over night, the <persName>Barbarossa</persName> our boat not starting until tomorrow at 11 o'clock. Took <persName>Jean</persName> to the <name>Museo</name> this morning. Found the <orgName>Pompeian</orgName> rooms closed - many repairs and changes, and great improvements going on. Weather very bad - tempestuous and heavy rains. <name>Vesuvius</name> not to be seen. We made a good run in the <orgName>Lahn</orgName> - and barring no deck cabins, were most comfy. This is our run - 361. 412. 396. 388. 405. 404. 410. 410. 411. 422 - then <persName>Naples,</persName> - the morning of the 11th day.</p>

          <p>A week of visiting and getting the boat ready. Among our fellow passengers on the <persName>Barbarossa</persName> were a Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Dennis</persName> coming out to <placeName>Egypt</placeName> - he to devote himself to <orgName>Egyptology.</orgName> They are from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> - youngish people and very nice. He has been preparing himself by study at the <placeName>Johns Hopkins</placeName> - and his whole heart and soul are in it. He expects to join the <placeName>Petrie</placeName> camp. Also an <orgName>English</orgName> family on board, Lord and <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> - with a <orgName>Doctor, a Mental Healer</orgName> (whatever that is) but that is what they call the young woman who was constantly with <persName>Lord Clinton.</persName> He is an old man, and out of his mind, and seems to be unconscious of everything around him. They too, came to <placeName>Egypt</placeName> - and intend passing the winter at <placeName>Asw&#226;n.</placeName> The <orgName>Quibells</orgName> dined with us the other evening - and we lunched with them today - and met for the first time <persName>Dr. Grenfell</persName> and <persName>Dr. Hunt</persName> - such interesting people always together in work and life. One is hardly mentioned without the other. There was also a Mr. <persName>Loat,</persName> who lives near <placeName>Oxford</placeName> - and has been studying the birds and fishes of the <placeName>Soudan</placeName> for two or three years. He had the most entrancing stories about them, and hippos and all the <orgName>African</orgName> animals. We sat in the little garden under a big tree, and stayed to tea. All our <orgName>Nile</orgName> friends are gone up the river. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> whom we saw on the <orgName>Istar</orgName> the day before he sailed. He is going to join <persName>Somers-Clarke</persName> and some men at <placeName>El Kab,</placeName> where they are going to thoroughly excavate this winter, being backed by <persName>Lionel Phillips,</persName> the <orgName>South African</orgName> millionaire. All the land about the site, has been conceded by the <orgName>Khodive</orgName> to a syndicate for developing natron - and whatever of interest and value remaining undiscovered on this very ancient ground, must be found and dug up, before this syndicate go to work there. The Birds on the <orgName>Zenet-el-Nil</orgName> started up two weeks ago. <persName>Abdul</persName> still very ill - we think he ought to go to the <placeName>Hospital</placeName> - but all these natives are so afraid of the hospital.</p>

          <p>We have had a busy and anxious week. <persName>Jean</persName> was not able to get up on Monday - and as she had not been quite herself since we landed I decided we ought to have the <orgName>Doctor.</orgName> Sent for Dr. <persName>Milton</persName> - who found her temperature 104 - with great pains in the back and legs. He thought she ought to be very carefully watched for a day or two, as it was impossible to say what these symptoms might lead to - so in two hours after his visit, the room next hers was vacated, and a very presentable <orgName>English</orgName> nurse was established there. Fortunately the evening brought a violent fit of sickness, after which the fever left her, the night was good - she was decidedly better the next day, and continued improving. <persName>Miss Bowdon</persName> proved such a good nurse and companion, that we begged her to stay her week out, and she is still here; it has been a great relief to me, and a help and comfort to Jean. <persName>Jean</persName> and she have been spending most of the day in the garden. We had however, one very anxious day - with the possibility of typhoid before us! At the dahabeah this afternoon - <persName>Baroness Trentenberg</persName> came to tea - and young Mr. <persName>Edgar</persName> came in too. We lunched on Friday with the <orgName>Dennis's</orgName> - <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> and her daughter being there. Unfortunately the good north wind which has been blowing ever since we arrived, stopped blowing yesterday - and the cold south wind has raged since. Yesterday <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> and her two daughters came in from the <placeName>Mena House</placeName> and had tea with us on the <orgName>Beduin,</orgName> and inspected the boat with much interest.</p>

This Home belongs to Dr. <persName>Milton</persName> - and here he has his private hospital - to which place <persName>Abdul</persName> has been removed. <persName>Miss Bowdon</persName> has been most helpful in making all the arrangements - and <persName>Abdul</persName> will be under her care - and she will give us news of him from time to time, and she and Dr. <persName>Milton</persName> will have a special interest in him.

The poor, good fellow looked fearfully ill - and was so glad to see me, that he quite lost his self-possession. We saw <persName>Miss Bowdon</persName> who says that Dr. <persName>Milton</persName> does not at all accept the serious view of the native doctor.

He pushed his head into the opening, but found the air so foul, that he had to retreat to one of the upper parts of the corridor and stop awhile - then he went back and made a hurried reconnoitre, which revealed a large room with what appeared to be other chambers opening from it. <persName>Theo</persName> said that when <persName>Carter</persName> emerged from the tomb, he was a horrid object - dripping and wet from the heat, with a black dust over his face and hands - he was very sick too, and had to lie down for sometime. He said the air was filled with a suffocating odour, like ammonia, and that great masses of black stuff like black stalactites were hanging from the ceiling. It is hard business for him and the workmen. A council of war was then held, and as evidently it will take some time to clear these chambers <persName>Theo</persName> decided to go on to <placeName>Asw&#226;n</placeName> tomorrow which we are now ready to do.</p>

        <p>Mr. <persName>Carter</persName> arrived yesterday, and reported the tomb making good progress - some other fragments had been found, with the cartouches of the <orgName>Queen.</orgName> Went to the hotel and made some visits. The <persName>Stimsons</persName> all came to tea - he so much better. Miss <persName>Alice Longfellow</persName> and her friend <persName>Miss Curtis</persName> also came - the former having had a letter of introduction to me from <persName>Mrs. Goodwin</persName> of Boston. When they had all gone, we took <persName>Mildred</persName> and rowed around the island and back to her hotel. An enchanting evening so still, and warm and dry. I love <persName>Asw&#226;n,</persName> in spite of its new big hotels and steamers - such a delicious climate - and wonderful scenery. <persName>Theo</persName> took <persName>Mildred</persName> up to the hotel, and encountered <persName>Newberry</persName> who had just arrived. He is the guest of Princess <persName>Henry</persName> of <placeName>Battenburg</placeName> - for the <name>Royal Arms of England</name> have been floating from one of the towers of the <placeName>Cataract</placeName> hotel ever since we came. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> dined with us - and we had such a pleasant evening. He interested me very much talking of <orgName>Coptic</orgName> - <orgName>Byzantine</orgName> and <name>Celtic Art</name> - and told me about the "Book of <persName>Kells"</persName> of which I have never heard - and which I intend to investigate. The <orgName>Encyclopedia</orgName> which we have on board says, "that Kells (originally Keulis) is an ancient town of <placeName>County Meath, Leicester, Ireland,</placeName> situated on the <placeName>Blackwater</placeName> 26 miles by rail from <placeName>Dragheda.</placeName> Among several very interesting antiquities there, is the house of <placeName>St. Columba,</placeName> a round tower, and 3-4 stone crosses. <persName>Kells</persName> was made the centre of a bishops see in 809 - this was united to the see of <placeName>Meath</placeName> in the 13th century. A manuscript copy of the gospels called the <orgName>Book of Kells,</orgName> is beautifully executed with coloured <orgName>Celtic</orgName> ornamentation, and is believed to be the work of the 9th century. It is now preserved in the <placeName>Library of Trinity College,</placeName> Dublin. Mr. <persName>Sayce</persName> also told us of the work this year at <placeName>El Kab,</placeName> where he has been most of the winter. It was intended to be exhaustive and to finish the excavation of this ancient site. They were disappointed in the results - shafts sunk in the temple, showed work of the 18 dynasty - under this, potteries of the III dynasty, showing a likeness to the so-called early <orgName>Cretan</orgName> forms - under these were found walls of pre-dynastic times. We get off tomorrow.</p>

          <p>A very busy day - <persName>Theo, Jean</persName> and I went over early to <placeName>Karnak</placeName> to see the wonderful things <name>Monsieur Le Grain</name> has been finding lately. There is a "hole" one might say, perhaps 50 feet square, or more, which he discovered this year - it lies just at the corner formed by the pylon of <placeName>Amenhotep,</placeName> and the wall on which the story of <name>Pentaur</name> is written. Here he has found and been taking out all winter the most wonderful things. He showed me today a little exquisite status in basalt - seated about a foot high, which he had taken out that morning, and which he told me was the 97th statue, big and little which he had taken out. It is more or less filled by infiltration, with water, and in this hundred or more <orgName>Arabs</orgName> and boys were grubbing - and hauling up stones with tackle etc. Some splendid great stones with exquisitely wrought hieroglyphs and inscriptions of <persName>Amenhotep</persName> I have been taken out almost unbroken - and laid together, having probably formed a chapel of that king. It is supposed that in some dangerous emergency, all these things were concealed in this "cache" for they were not carelessly put there - and have come out almost unharmed. The most beautiful thing I ever saw of its kind in <orgName>Egyptian</orgName> art, had been taken up to his own house - <name>Le Grain's</name> - a kneeling figure about 4 ft. high, in purest alabaster, and leaning with both hands on a stela. Its beauty, finish and modeling were almost Greek. It represents <persName>Ramses</persName> III. <name>Le Grain</name> has certainly had a wonderful success. Then we galloped madly back to town, for the donkeys are so fresh, and stopped at the <placeName>Murches</placeName> for a farewell visit, and a pleasant one. Then to the <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> to ask the <persName>Misses Collins</persName> to tea this afternoon - and Mrs. and <persName>Miss Coats</persName> - and home a little late for lunch. They all came and we had a pleasant afternoon. After they went, Mr. <persName>Livermore</persName> of <placeName>Boston</placeName> called - then came Mr. <persName>Carter</persName> - with latest news of the tomb - and finally said goodbye until he comes down to us at <placeName>Cairo,</placeName> and stays until we leave. This is the sketch of the burial chamber as it now is - tomorrow they begin to work on No. 5 - <persName>Mr. Carter</persName> thinks it may take until May to clear it entirely - and to get up the sarcophagi and other things. He reports these and a fine canopic box to be made of crystalline red sandstone, beautifully polished and inscribed. [diagram of sarcophagus: page 32 of pdf] 	A.B. lid and sarcophagus of the <orgName>Queen.</orgName> <name>C.D.</name> lid and sarcophagus of <placeName>Thotmes</placeName> I. 	E.

The big mountain mass of <name>Gebel et-Tarif</name> has been in sight for 3 days. We are lying at a very high bank, which partly protects us from the wind. It has so increased in violence since 6 o'clock that extra stakes and cables have been put out. All the deck furniture is massed together - and the heavy rugs which are always piled at night on the divans, are tied down with ropes. The men could have no awning over them tonight.

It seems that he had written and telegraphed to us at <placeName>Nagh Hamadi</placeName> and <placeName>Balliana</placeName> - <persName>Mrs. L.</persName> had gone to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> a week before under strong protest. It was such a hot morning and already so late, that we decided not to go up to the camp - though I was very anxious to see the fine <orgName>Coptic</orgName> things lately found. Sohag.

          Wednesday, Mar. 16. 50 miles. A warm, khamseeny day - with light south wind, before which with the current we came along finely - it is delightful sailing this way. We have been on deck under the awnings most of the day - near <placeName>Aboutig.</placeName>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Thursday, Mar. 17. 8 miles. Strong head winds today, for a change. It is comforting to think that a tug starts up today from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to meet us! <persName>Else,</persName> we would not be able to reach <placeName>Cairo</placeName> on the 26th. 11 miles above Asy&#251;t.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Friday, Mar. 18. 40 miles. Another good day of light <placeName>S.</placeName> wind. Reached <placeName>Asy&#251;t</placeName> at 8:30 - passed the bridge without trouble, but with the usual excitement in the lock. Very hot today - we are lying opposite the beginning of the great mountain chain of <persName>Abu Feda</persName> and the <placeName>Ramses III</placeName> is just across from us. Her electric lights look strangely, against those dim great cliffs.

          Saturday, Mar. 19. 52-1/2 miles, 	15 by sail-	38-1/2 by tug. Light south wind today - about 12 our tug put in its unexpected appearance. We were not looking for it until day after tomorrow. The Capt. and sailors knew nothing of it having been ordered, and their astonishment was great when she pulled up. The men gladly put away their oars this hot day. At 3 we reached <persName>Beni-Hassan</persName> - and <persName>Jean</persName> had the courage to go to the tombs with <persName>Jones.</persName> They did not stay long, it was so hot - and came back with Mr. <persName>Garstang</persName> and to our amazement, with <persName>Baron v. Bissing</persName> - who had come up to decide upon the division of this years spoils with <persName>Mr. Garstang.</persName> The <persName>Baron</persName> had his bag and valise, and we gladly brought him along with us. For a week past, we have been going through such beautiful country - such rich crops - barley ripening - wheat high and green - blossoming crops - and everywhere the larks singing among them. There is a tiny little crescent of a moon made her appearance last night. Opposite Minia.

      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Fifth Sunday in <placeName>Lent,</placeName> March 20. 83-1/2 miles. A very uncomfortable day of heat - a good south wind too all the way - until late in the afternoon. These last few days of heat and haze have seemed very like a mild <orgName>Khamseen</orgName> - and are rather oppressive - and such singular colouring - and no sunshine. A pallid atmosphere - and desert, rocks and river a sepia brown - with the trees and crops a vivid green, almost lurid green. At one sport, a mass of white and mauve poppies standing in a row amongst the green bearded wheat, was really too lovely. We are lying opposite Benisoef.

      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Monday, March 21. 58 miles. Bedrasheyn. The wind blew hard and cool all day - we drew here a little after 2 o'clock - and sent the tug "Anubis" on to <placeName>Cairo.</placeName> It was the best tug and the best Captain we have ever had. <persName>Theron,</persName> the <persName>Baron</persName> and <persName>Jean</persName> took donkeys and rode as far as the <orgName>Ramesis</orgName> colussus.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          <name>Bedrasheyn</name> - Tuesday, Mar. 22. All went off to <placeName>Sakkara</placeName> for the day - I in my chair with two excellent donkeys. It was a dark cool day, with high wind - just such a day as last year when we were here - but that was at the beginning of the winter - and now this richly cultivated country is brilliantly green with crops - the wheat in full head. We lunched as usual at <placeName>Mariettes</placeName> house on the terrace, which was dismally cold, and we were covered with sand. Unfortunately Mr. <persName>Weigall</persName> who is working there had elected to go to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> for the day, so we missed him. <persName>v. Bissing</persName> is publishing some of the <placeName>Sakkara</placeName> tombs and <persName>Weigall</persName> is doing the photographing - he has been here all winter, and the work will take yet 5 years to complete it. After lunch we went to the tomb of <orgName>Ka-gem-na,</orgName> which I had never seen before. <persName>V. Bissing</persName> has had this lighted from above, as <placeName>Ti's</placeName> tomb is lighted, and the very charming decoration can be well seen. This tomb was discovered in 1893. Then we went to the street of <persName>Tombs,</persName> discovered by <persName>Loret</persName> in 1899 - and found it very interesting. The others went down to <persName>Meri's</persName> tomb, but I started home. <persName>V. Bissing</persName> took the 8:40 train to <placeName>Cairo.</placeName>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Wednesday, Mar. 23. 6 miles. We started early, and got about opposite <persName>Tura,</persName> when we were obliged to anchor in mid stream and there we lay until 6 o'clock P.M. The wind blowing a gale all day. We had 2 anchors out and the waves were really big.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Thursday, Mar. 24th. We found a gentle south wind this morning, which brought us easily down to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> at 8 o'clock - and had to wait until 11:30 for the opening of the bridge. So we landed and went to the Museum - met <persName>Mrs. Metcalfe</persName> in the <placeName>Gold Room</placeName> - and promised to dine with her tomorrow at Shepheards. <persName>Saw Newberry</persName> for a few moments. Got through the bridge with much excitement, and with a large audience - as the wind was strong and from the side. Came to the <placeName>Ghezireh Palace</placeName> Landing.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Friday, March 25. Just home from dining with <persName>Mrs. Metcalfe.</persName> Not many people at <placeName>Shepheards</placeName> - and how dreary it looked - and how thankful we were to get home. Spent the morning shopping - and to the races in the afternoon - where we were almost frozen - and again glad to get home. Dr. and <persName>Mrs. Campbell</persName> called.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Saturday, Mar. 26. Another really cold day - we spent the morning at the <placeName>Museum,</placeName> where we fell in with the <orgName>Baron,</orgName> and brought him home to luncheon. In the afternoon we went to the <placeName>Campbells</placeName> - and then to see some lovely <orgName>Arab</orgName> glass - and other things at <placeName>Kitycas's</placeName> - we are now busy getting ready for packing - and how I hate to leave this pleasant little, quiet home!
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Sunday before Easter - Mar. 27. Indoors all day - <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Jean</persName> went to the <placeName>Zoo</placeName> this afternoon. <persName>Mr. Newberry</persName> here to tea.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Monday, Mar. 28th. To the <placeName>Campbells</placeName> to dine. Came this afternoon to the <placeName>Ghezireh Hotel.</placeName> Very busy all the morning packing, arranging etc. <persName>Mr. Carter</persName> arrived.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Tuesday, Mar. 29. Drove out to the <placeName>Pyramids</placeName> - all of us - stopped a moment at the <placeName>Mena House,</placeName> and spoke to Lady <persName>Clinton</persName> and her daughter and <persName>Robert,</persName> with whom we were to take tea. Then we visited the <persName>Reisner</persName> camp, saw Mrs. R., <persName>Mrs. Lythgoe</persName> and Mr. <persName>R. Mrs. Lythoe</persName> went back to the hotel with us for lunch - and we also had <persName>Robert.</persName> Saw the Misses Collins, Mrs. Bruce, Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Dennis</persName> - and after sitting about in the usual sleepy fashion, we mounted donkeys - <persName>Theo, Jean</persName> and I, and Mr. <persName>Carter</persName> and <persName>Robert</persName> walking, went up to <placeName>Lady Clinton's</placeName> camp - up on the high plateau, with lovely views of pyramids, desert and cultivated plain. There were many tents - and looked most comfortable and even pretty. But if I were camping I should want square tents instead of round ones. Had such a pleasant visit. Mrs. <persName>Lythgoe</persName> went back to <placeName>Girga</placeName> in the afternoon - and we drove home in a howling cold wind. <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> seemed worried about Lord <persName>Clinton</persName> who is at the <placeName>Mena House</placeName> - with his doctor and nurse. It would be a mercy to the poor man to die, I should think. Mr. <persName>Carter</persName> tells us nothing more was found in the tomb - it was thoroughly searched and the sarcophagi are part way up the passage - as well as the canopic box.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Wednesday, Mar. 30. I had such an uncomfortable night - and found on getting up at 6 this morning that a regular <name>Kamseen</name> was coming on. The air was so thick that I could dimly see the opposite side of the river - and the air was amazingly hot - dangerously so it seemed. Soon the wind began, and although we did not feel its full force on this side of the house, we got enough of its noise and dust. The portar told us they had never seen here a worse condition. <persName>Theo</persName> and I went down to the boat soon after breakfast, having had <persName>Billy</persName> up to breakfast, and I packed away all the <orgName>Hashepsut</orgName> deposits - I had intended going into town, but it was too hot - and I came back to the big, cool rooms which we have here. We have had them before - the <orgName>Khedivial</orgName> rooms - huge, lofty, magnificently furnished - but too big and grand for real comfort. Mrs. <persName>Metcalfe</persName> and <persName>Mr.</persName> and Mrs. <persName>Dennis</persName> came to lunch and one of the first things the latter told us was that Lord <persName>Clinton</persName> had died last night very suddenly. We feel such sympathy for <persName>Lady Clinton</persName> - but it surely is a mercy for them all. Mrs. <persName>Dennis</persName> said <persName>Lady C.</persName> was completely overcome. This evening a note from <persName>Robert</persName> came confirming it. We all drove into town this afternoon shopped a little - had tea on the terrace at <placeName>Shepheards</placeName> - in all the noise and smells. <placeName>Cairo</placeName> is rapidly thinning. The <orgName>Dennis's</orgName> sail tomorrow for <placeName>America</placeName> - and <persName>Mrs. Metcalfe</persName> in the same boat, <orgName>Canopic;</orgName> but she gets off at <placeName>Naples.</placeName> It is still very warm and oppressive.

      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Thursday, Mar. 31. <persName>Jean</persName> and I with <persName>Theodore</persName> went over to town - we left him doing dozens of things, while we went down to the bazaar to buy <persName>Mrs. Kane's</persName> scarf. In the afternoon we went over again with Carter. Saw the <persName>Newmans</persName> at <placeName>Shepheards,</placeName> and took tea with them - and had a view of <persName>Ms. N's</persName> paintings of <placeName>Abu Simbal.</placeName> Dr. <persName>Sandwith</persName> dined with us, and was most pleasant all the evening.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Friday, April 1st. <persName>Jean, Carter</persName> and I went to the <placeName>Zoo</placeName> this morning - on reaching home found <persName>Baron v. Bissing</persName> and <persName>Mr. Weigall,</persName> who stayed to lunch with us. A man from the bazaar brought over some things for us to look at and I bought enough peridotes for a necklace - which I will have mounted some day. <persName>Lady Oppenheim</persName> and another <orgName>English</orgName> lady came up to the sitting room and played bridge with <persName>Theo</persName> and Carter. When we got upstairs, <persName>Jean</persName> and I, I found <persName>Theo</persName> looking awfully bored. <persName>Lady Oppenheim,</persName> a handsome, quite elderly woman, with white hair, beautifully dressed, very decolet&#232;, smoking cigarettes, with her glasses on her nose, intent upon her game, did not seem to me a lovely example of old age.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          April 2d. Saturday. In town this morning for various last things. <persName>Billy</persName> was up at the hotel all the morning helping us pack - to the destruction of a favorite basket of mine, which he seized, and destroyed before I could get it from him. This afternoon we again went into town to make some parting visits - among them one to the <name>Tytus's</name> in their temporary appartment. <persName>Baron v. Bissing,</persName> Mr. <persName>Weigall</persName> and <persName>Carter</persName> dined with us - a very pleasant evening.

          April 3d. Sunday, Easter. Port Said, SS. Isis. We left <placeName>Cairo</placeName> this morning at 11:30 - a charming day. All the men were at the station to see us off - dear little <persName>Billy</persName> with them. A very comfortable journey to <placeName>Port Said</placeName> - and we are most comfortably settled in this fine little boat, and hope to have a good crossing. But the <orgName>Indian</orgName> ship bringing the mail is telegraphed almost a day late, and we will have to wait many hours for her.

          <placeName>Venice</placeName> - <placeName>Hotel</placeName> Britannia. Friday, April 8th. Arrived this afternoon at 4:30 having spent last night in our old quarters at the <placeName>Hotel Breen.</placeName> The crossing was very fair, and we had a very pleasant company - especially Sir <persName>William Preece</persName> and his daughters. We went out immediately after our arrival in our gondolas to <placeName>Salvadore's</placeName> - found little that we wanted - then went to <placeName>San Marco's</placeName> - walked about the piazza and exterior - and had tea at <placeName>Florians</placeName> - then went into that exquisite wonderful church where a service was going on, and loitered about - walked back to the hotel.

      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          Saturday, April 9th. A rather cold day, spent the morning at the <placeName>Academia</placeName> and the afternoon between <placeName>Berozzi's</placeName> and the <placeName>Bensons</placeName> - found them about as usual. Though Mr. <persName>B.</persName> looked old and tired. <persName>Mrs. B.</persName> as crippled and suffering, but as vivacious and charming as ever. Met the daughter <persName>Miss Fletcher</persName> for the first time - an attractive, clever woman. Had tea at home - we are in the same rooms we have occupied for 4 years, each spring.
      </div>
      <div xml:id="EBA-1904-">
          First Sunday after Easter. April 10th. <persName>Jean</persName> and I spent our morning at <placeName>St. Marks</placeName> and this afternoon we all went to the <placeName>Bensons</placeName> for tea, as <persName>Miss Fletcher</persName> had begged us yesterday to do. Several pleasant people were there - and among them Mrs. <persName>Humphery Ward</persName> who interested me so much. A fine delicate face - and simple unaffected manner with no consciousness of being a remarkable woman. I talked with her some time. She was especially interested in the <orgName>Oxyrinthus</orgName> finds of <name>Grenfell</name> and <persName>Hunt</persName> in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> - and asked me many questions about it.

          Tuesday, April 12th. This morning was spent at <placeName>Dorigo's</placeName> and at the <placeName>Museo Civico</placeName> - the afternoon in making a delightful visit to Mr. and Mrs. <persName>John Humphreys Johnson,</persName> who had asked us to see their garden - away out beyond the church of <placeName>Madonna San Orto</placeName> quite on the outer edge of <placeName>Venice</placeName> - looking across the lagoon over to <placeName>Burano</placeName> and the snow clad <placeName>Alps</placeName> beyond - a charming quite, far away spot. They have bought a larger property here, extending along the canal or <placeName>Rio di S. Alvin.</placeName> Three large gardens are included in it - and 3 houses - the <name>Palace Minelli</name> in which they live is one of them, and is interesting in the extreme. They received us in one of the gardens - and we walked about the whole place, until we came to the court of their own palace. They have had the place for a year. They have no children - he is an artist - she is a rampant gardener - and they are hugely enjoying their new toy - renovating, changing and improving - with great care preserving all original features - we had tea there. <persName>Crafin Ross, Alice's</persName> friend with whom she has been traveling, came to dine.

The day was cold and threatening so we played bridge until it was time to start. A cold, tiring, rainy day, had to change cars at <placeName>Bologna</placeName> - found <persName>Nettie</persName> waiting for us, and brought her to the hotel to dine with us.

They showed us the so-called <persName>Raphael</persName> portrait, a charming picture, but hardly the work of that great master. It might be by <persName>Guilio Romano.</persName> The picture has been signed, but the signature has been mostly obliterated. I never knew it to rain harder than it has most of the afternoon. Kept <persName>Nettie</persName> for dinner. Such a sad thing has occurred here this morning. <persName>Cecily Northcote,</persName> the young <orgName>English</orgName> girl who was staying with the <persName>Websters</persName> two summers ago in <placeName>Newport</placeName> and whom we know, a cousin of <persName>Farrers</persName> as well as the <orgName>Websters</orgName> - died with typhoid fever at the <placeName>Hotel de la Ville.</placeName> She came to <placeName>Italy</placeName> with <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Hamilton Fish Webster</persName> two months ago - they arrived from <placeName>Rome</placeName> 10 days ago, quite ailing, and today the whole thing was over for the poor young thing.

The girls to lunch, a heavy thunder storm this afternoon - went early to the <placeName>Villino</placeName> and had tea - and stayed late. Am a little disturbed at <placeName>Lizie's</placeName> appearance - she looks ill. A lovely sight from my window last night just before going to bed. The rain had stopped, but the moon was breaking through the clouds, and reflected in the river; and made me think of the old song the words by <persName>Longfellow</persName> I think, which I used to sing hundreds of years ago, called "the <persName>Bridge",</persName> - the last lines of which run something like this. "And forever and forever, 	As long as the river flows, 	As long as life hath passions 	As long as life hath woes, 	The moon and her broken reflection, 	And the shadows shall appear - 	Like the image of love in heaven and its wavering image here.

I thought best that <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName>Jean</persName> should have a rest today so we shopped and drove about, <persName>Nettie</persName> came to lunch, and we all, <persName>Lizzie</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName> included, went by invitation to Mrs. <persName>Newmans</persName> to tea - and had an enchanting visit. Their appartment at the top of an old palace in a quiet odd little piazza on the other side off the river, is filled with a wealth of lovely and choice things collected in a 30 years sojourn in <placeName>Italy</placeName> and Japan. I am always interested in these two people - so happily and quietly contented with themselves and each other - so busy, in a quiet way - and so surrounded by some if not most of the best things of life. It has poured with rain all the afternoon.

          Tuesday, April 26. <persName>Mary</persName> came down, and went with us to <placeName>St. Croce</placeName> this morning. I never tire of this grand church - one of the most impressive I know. They are carefully washing off much of the whitewash from pillars and walls, seeking for frescoes. We afterwards drove and walked in the <placeName>Cascine,</placeName> and this afternoon went to <orgName>Lizzie's.</orgName> She was not well last night - and felt poorly today.

          A charming, pleasant day. The girls came early and we had almost the whole morning at the <persName>S. Maria Novella,</persName> and <persName>S. Lorenzo</persName> and the two <orgName>Sacristies.</orgName> <persName>Nettie</persName> lunched with us - we went to the <placeName>Villino</placeName> for tea, and <persName>Nettie</persName> sang gloriously for us. Soon after lunch <persName>Gio.</persName> <persName>Placci</persName> called and made a long pleasant visit - soon after he left <placeName>Pearsall-Smith</placeName> came. This evening we have had the most glorious roses sent us - and are almost smothered in them.

This morning a drive to the <placeName>Cortosa,</placeName> which we had all to ourselves, and in the afternoon we did the <placeName>Duomo</placeName> and <persName>Baptistery,</persName> had tea at the tea <persName>Room,</persName> and a turn in the <placeName>Cascine</placeName> - <persName>Nettie</persName> dined with us.

            Saturday, April 30. To the <persName>Cobbs</persName> this morning - to see the pretty leather work. Left <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName>Jean</persName> at <persName>S. Marco,</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName> and I drove up to the <placeName>Rose Garden</placeName> near <placeName>S. Miniato.</placeName> Such miles of splendid roses! Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Newman</persName> to lunch - pleasant. <persName>Jean</persName> and I then went out to <persName>Lettignano</persName> to have tea with the <orgName>Berensons.</orgName> We had been asked to lunch, but could only make it to tea. They were very amusing and interesting about their <orgName>American</orgName> visit.

            Fourth Sunday after Easter. May 1st. <persName>Jean, Nettie</persName> and I went to the church of <placeName>Santisseina Annunziata,</placeName> and heard a splendid high mass. A great congregation. Then to the <placeName>Villino</placeName> for the day, which was a very pleasant one. Mrs. Tribe came in to tea. <persName>Jean</persName> and I drove in the <orgName>Cascine,</orgName> it was so very warm - but there was too great a crowd to make it pleasant.

            Monday, May 2d. A warm day - <persName>Jean</persName> taking a day of rest - so <persName>Nettie</persName> and I went to the <placeName>Uffizzi</placeName> - the girls lunched here, and <persName>Lizzie</persName> came to tea. The weather most lovely.

            Tuesday, May 3d. I sent <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName>Jean</persName> to drive in the <placeName>Cascine</placeName> this morning - and I stayed at home. <persName>Mary</persName> to lunch. At 4 o'clock we drove out to Mrs. <persName>Gregory Smiths</persName> - at the <placeName>Villa Bella Riposa.</placeName> They bought this beautiful villa 3 years ago - it has an enchanting garden - with fine view. A charming afternoon, and some pleasant people. I was so interested in some things Mrs. <persName>Smith</persName> told us - about the house. After they had bought it, they were told of a remarkable thing by the people of whom they bought it - to which they did not give much attention at first, until they heard from a church dignitary (Mrs. <persName>Smith</persName> is <persName>Catholic)</persName> that it actually had occurred, and the whole story, trial and punishment was to be found in the Florentine Archives. One of the daughters of the house loved a man the family did not with her to marry - she became a nun - but excaped from the Convent and joined the man. She was afterwards found and with her child was taken home - the <persName>Cardinal</persName> came from <placeName>Florence</placeName> and presided at the trial, which took place in the great hall at which all of the family were present. She was walled up between the what is now drawing room and library - and found there by the people of whom the <name>Smiths</name> bought the house. She was bricked up to the shoulders, and her baby laid at her feet - when the <persName>Smiths</persName> had the drawing room redecorated, the place in the wall from which she was taken, could be seen - a ghastly history! At another part of the house we were shown a little stone staircase which led to the next floor, where it had been solidly walled up - it led below to a passage which they explored as far as the gate of the <orgName>Villa.</orgName> Along the terrace and in the garden I noticed some terra-cotta jars 3 ft. or more high, of a very peculiar shape. There were 50 of them found in a wall of great thickness which Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> was obliged to take down in his repairs. Altogether it is a most interesting house - but I don't think I would care for so many associations with the past in a house I lived in; so many human experiences, and such gruesome ones, would be intolerable to me. Better a clean present and a new house. A chapel and a sacristy form part of the house - from which the ancient dead however, have been removed.</p>
