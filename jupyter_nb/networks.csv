1910-10-31,#Troyon_Constant,,"Paris – Oct. 31. Westminster Hotel. We made Plymouth at 7 o'clock this morning – I got up and looked out at the interesting coast – reached Cherbourg at 1 p.m. and were off at 3. We felt some little trepidation at committing ourselves to a French railway – there has been such a history of accidents in France! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired – as was shown by the piles of the old sleepers all along the road – in the most astounding state of decay – utter rottenness – they gave damning evidence of neglect. I had never seen the Brittany country before. How charming those wide reaching fields were, in the late afternoon light – so softly green – and the characteristic, mostly pollarded trees in their tints of bronze and olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that looked as if they might have been painted by Troyon or Corot. It was a blissful afternoon – and we so enjoyed it. Arrived in Paris at 10 – and found Mr. Rathbone waiting for us.

1911-02-19,#Farrer_Gaspard,,"Sunday. Feb. 19th. A rather monotonous week of constant visitors. Amongst the most pleasant were Mr. and Mrs. John Collander Livingston, and daughter sent by Mrs. Hamilton Fish Webster. Delightful people. Our neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Auchincloss and Miss Jennings, M. and Mme. Naville and M. Rodier to dine. Mrs. and Miss Wherry, sisters of Mr. Cust, M. and Mme. Maspero and others. Theo and I had a charming afternoon with Mr. Carter in his new house – so well built and arranged and pretty – it looked like the abode of an artist and a scholar. He is just opening a large tomb or cachette for Lord Carnarvon – and when we had tea, he went back at once to his work. The Hon. Henry and Mrs. Hobhouse (from G. Farrer) dined with us this evening. Theo is to give them lunch in the Valley tomorrow.","<div type=""entry"" xml:id=""EBA-1911-02-19""><dateline><date when=""1911-02-19"">Sunday.
