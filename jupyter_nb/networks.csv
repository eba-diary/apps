1910-10-31,#Troyon_Constant,,"Paris – Oct. 31. Westminster Hotel. We made Plymouth at 7 o'clock this morning – I got up and looked out at the interesting coast – reached Cherbourg at 1 p.m. and were off at 3. We felt some little trepidation at committing ourselves to a French railway – there has been such a history of accidents in France! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired – as was shown by the piles of the old sleepers all along the road – in the most astounding state of decay – utter rottenness – they gave damning evidence of neglect. I had never seen the Brittany country before. How charming those wide reaching fields were, in the late afternoon light – so softly green – and the characteristic, mostly pollarded trees in their tints of bronze and olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that looked as if they might have been painted by Troyon or Corot. It was a blissful afternoon – and we so enjoyed it. Arrived in Paris at 10 – and found Mr. Rathbone waiting for us. They are at the Bedford.",12.0
